    "text": "A Davis Polk team led by partners Greg Andres, Antonio Perez-Marques and Micah Block received runner-up honors in AmLaw Litigation Daily’s “Litigator of the Week” column for securing a summary judgement win for Meta Platforms and WhatsApp in litigation against NSO Group, seeking to hold the Israeli technology company liable for a 2019 spyware attack targeting WhatsApp and its users.\n\nOn December 20, 2024, Judge Phyllis J. Hamilton in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a decision granting summary judgment on all claims in favor of Meta and WhatsApp, finding NSO Group liable for violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), the California Comprehensive Computer Data Access and Fraud Act (CDAFA), and for breaching WhatsApp’s Terms of Service.  In so ruling, Judge Hamilton also granted in part Meta and WhatsApp’s motion for discovery sanctions, based on NSO Group’s failure, among other things, to produce the source code for Pegasus as ordered by the court.  Judge Hamilton scheduled a trial solely on damages for March 2025.\n\nIn a complaint filed in October 2019, Meta and WhatsApp alleged that between April and May 2019, NSO Group accessed WhatsApp’s servers without authorization in order to install Pegasus spyware on the mobile devices of more than 1,400 WhatsApp users. Meta and WhatsApp identified NSO Group as the source of the attack, and determined that NSO‘s victims included journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents, and others.\n\nIn its December 2024 order granting summary judgment, the Court concluded that NSO Group was subject to personal jurisdiction in California, that NSO Group exceeded its authorization to access the WhatsApp servers in violation of the CFAA and CDAFA, and that NSO Group violated the WhatsApp Terms of Service in developing Pegasus.  The Court also found that NSO Group should face sanctions for failing to produce discovery and disobeying court orders.  The next phase of the case will resolve the amount of damages to which WhatsApp and Meta are entitled.\n\nThe case marks the first time that a commercial spyware company has been held liable in U.S. court.  It is also the first U.S. court decision of liability against NSO Group, which was added to the Department of Commerce Entity List for activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States in November 2021.\n\nThe Davis Polk team included partners Greg D. Andres, Antonio J. Perez-Marques, and Micah G. Block, counsel Gina Cora, Craig T. Cagney, and Andrew Yaphe, associates Esther C. Townes, Luca Marzorati, James C. Butler, Muhammad Sardar, Olivia Constance Bethea, Gersham Johnson, Quentin J. Ullrich, Amelia Birnie, Kaitlin Campanini, Meenu Mathews, Tyler Conroy, Thomas Floyd and Cyerra Haywood.\n\n“Runners-Up and Shout-Outs for Litigator of the Week,” AmLaw Litigation Daily (January 9, 2025) (subscription required)",

So, certainly we expect that refinancing work to get busier.”\n\nHe continued, “The theme to watch now is going to be how quickly rates come down and how quickly that spurs an uptick in M&A activity, but we are certainly optimistic about more deals getting done in the next 12 months.”\n\n“Creative deal structuring spurs an uptick,” Private Equity International (November 1, 2024)",

She also said directors at banks with $5 billion in assets should begin considering the impact of this proposal, given the likelihood they would be subjected to it in future years, and encouraged directors at FDIC-examined banks to read the proposal and submit a comment letter to the agency ahead of the December 11th due date.\n\n“Proposal Blurs Line Between Boards and Management, Critics Say,” Bank Director (November 20, 2023)",

Creative investor relations professionals found new, pithy ways of communicating the health of the portfolio,” he said, suggesting regular town halls, frequent periodic updates, audio-visual media and maintaining an ongoing dialogue as some useful communication techniques.\n\n“PE in a Recession: Fortify Existing Funds in Accordance With Fund Terms, Obtain Liquidity and Manage Skittish Investors (Part Two of Three),” Private Equity Law Report (September 27, 2022) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk tax partner Mario Verdolini and Pro Bono Counsel Nancy Marchand recently discussed the firm’s pro bono work with tax-exempt organizations. Mario leads a cross-practice – and often cross-border – Davis Polk team that helps an array of nonprofit organizations set up the tax structures needed to successfully address community needs.\n\nEven before he went to law school, Mario was active in assisting nonprofits. He has built upon that passion throughout his career, having worked with hundreds of diverse organizations.\n\n“All nonprofits we work with address some kind of community need,” Mario said, from assisting disadvantaged individuals to addressing racial injustice to supporting the arts. In addition to setting up new nonprofits, the team works with existing nonprofits, government organizations and other not-for-profit community projects. He described working with a woman who gives tens of thousands of gifts out to children of families who can’t afford them. “She’s been doing it alone for years, but it became so large that she incorporated,” Mario said. “The gifts are for holidays, birthdays, achievements – it’s so important for children to receive recognition for the special events in their lives.”\n\nCross-practice and cross-border\n\nLike most other teams at Davis Polk, the lawyers work across practice groups to tackle these nonprofit tax matters. “Setting up a new nonprofit is a great opportunity for corporate and tax lawyers to work together on a pro bono matter,” said Nancy, a longtime Davis Polk lawyer who joined the pro bono team in 2020 to focus on the corporate side of nonprofit work. “It fits right into the firm culture of strong cross-departmental collaboration.”\n\nThe nonprofits are based around the United States, but also all over the world – Italy, Ethiopia, Germany, Guyana, Israel, the UK and other countries. Working cross-border comes with its own set of challenges. Davis Polk corporate and tax lawyers are currently helping a number of pro bono clients outside the United States set up new U.S. nonprofit corporations relating to their missions. This includes a Florence-based research and cultural center fostering understanding of Black history and a group of educators focused on global peace.\n\n“Setting up a corporation can be complicated, particularly if there are cross-border aspects,” Mario said. The team has to consider corporate governance, bylaws, environmental issues and more. “When a corporation is tax exempt, there are limits to what it can and can’t do.”\n\nDiverse causes\n\nDavis Polk takes on tax and corporate work for nonprofits with an array of different causes, including issues at the forefront of society right now. Mario and his team are assisting a new organization devoted to eliminating violence and discrimination against Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) individuals, including by conducting surveys to better identify issues in the current climate.\n\nMario and Nancy are constantly connecting with up-and-coming nonprofits with the potential to make positive change. The team recently began working with an environmental nonprofit helping set up solar energy centers in communities across New York. “The founders have been working for nearly a decade on improving solar energy,” Mario said. As we spoke, the team was also preparing for a call with New York City business leaders setting up a nonprofit to improve access to capital for Black-run businesses.\n\n“Nonprofit founders are passionate about what they do,” Nancy said. “If we can help them take care of tax and corporate formalities, they can focus more effectively on their missions.”\n\nLearn more about Davis Polk’s Pro Bono program.",

Addressing the potential for the new rules to reveal confidential information about dealmaking activity before companies announce a merger, Joe explained that the deadline for filing quarterly reports is 40 days after the quarter ends, which gives companies some time to potentially complete merger negotiations before revealing their daily buyback activity. But, Joe said, in some cases companies may still have to disclose a pause in buybacks related to private deal negotiations that were never revealed.\n\nHe explained, “There are some events where a company needs to be in quiet mode for weeks at a time and you still run the risk of disclosing that at some point in time there was material information. If in a quarterly report you have a 20-day period where there was a pause in purchases as the company was negotiating a deal that never was announced, you have to throw that out into the market with no explanation of it. Nobody is going to want to say we were negotiating a material deal and weren’t able to close it.”\n\n“New Buyback Reporting Rules May Expose Deal Talks,” The Deal (May 12, 2023) (subscription required)",

The American Lawyer notes the firm is “leveraging its reputation and history of working with financial institutions on major matters as they look for guidance in an uncertain atmosphere.”\n\nDavis Polk Chair and Managing Partner Neil Barr told AmLaw that it is too early to say whether the events of the last two-plus weeks will have a lasting impression on both the banking industry and the deal market moving forward. “Some of this will be discrete and time-limited, while other aspects will have meaningful tails,” Neil said. “And it’s not yet clear which is which. I certainly hope that for the sake of confidence in the financial system that this will abate quickly and that we go back to a more normal type of business environment.”\n\nThe firm’s role advising Japan Industrial Partners on its $15 billion acquisition of Toshiba, the largest deal announced last week, was also highlighted.\n\n“Deal Watch: Deals Down, Debt Offerings Up as Banking Saga Continues,” American Lawyer (March 28, 2023) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk is proud to have a strong and growing program of corporate and transactional pro bono work serving nonprofits, small businesses and other clients. One exciting project has been our assistance to a new nonprofit, the Council for Black Business Enterprises (CBBE). We recently spoke to Harshil Shukla, Pro Bono Attorney for Corporate & Transactional Matters, and Amber Leary, a third-year Restructuring associate, about this work.\n\nTell us about CBBE – its mission and the services it offers to Black-owned businesses.\n\nHarshil: Starting in early 2020, CBBE’s founder Danielle Douglas, a Black woman and owner of a consulting firm in New York City, brought together an amazing group of leaders in the local Black business community to address the systemic disparities Black-owned businesses face in securing access to capital and opportunities. The effort took on particular urgency during the COVID pandemic, which hit marginalized communities especially hard. The group’s programs include mentoring, networking and education, with a particular focus on capacity building and helping community members gain access to and succeed in securing contracting opportunities.\n\nHow did our lawyers get involved with CBBE?\n\nHarshil: CBBE board member Valerie White, the Senior Executive Director of nonprofit Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) NYC, knew Diane Lucas, our Pro Bono Counsel for Racial Justice Initiatives, and suggested Davis Polk work with CBBE to help the group get off the ground. We jumped at the opportunity because we really believe in the mission. This work connects with several strands of our pro bono program: our ongoing commitment to racial justice work, COVID-related assistance, and expanding our transactional and corporate pro bono practice.\n\nWhat types of work have we done for CBBE?\n\nHarshil: We helped CBBE incorporate as a Delaware nonprofit, which included drafting its bespoke organizational documents, and file its pending application with the IRS for tax-exempt status. Davis Polk lawyers attend nearly every board meeting and have recommended, drafted and helped implement a variety of policies and procedures, including on conflicts of interest, document retention and social media use. We also continue to help CBBE navigate the numerous requirements placed on nonprofits by state and local governments. Our efforts have put CBBE on firm footing from a legal and compliance standpoint, so it runs smoothly and can focus on its mission and services.\n\nAmber, what specifically have you worked on for CBBE?\n\nAmber: Among other work, I drafted CBBE’s gift acceptance policy, which is an important corporate governance document for any nonprofit. I personally presented it to the board at their March meeting, answering their questions and discussing possible revisions. The policy was discussed again and subsequently adopted in May.\n\nWhat other lawyers have worked on this project?\n\nHarshil: The team is led by senior counsel and former Mergers & Acquisitions partner John Bick and Tax partner Mario Verdolini. Other members include Nancy Marchand, counsel and Head of Corporate & Transactional Pro Bono, and associates Benjamin Helfgott (Tax), Steven Jaffe (M&A), Shua Mermelstein (Real Estate), Ben Silver (Tax) and SEO Law Fellow Karina Mendez.\n\nWhat has been most meaningful to you about our work for CBBE?\n\nHarshil: We have been intimately involved with CBBE and Danielle looks to us as a trusted adviser. It’s been really rewarding to see the organization grow and find ways to help at every stage. With the strong foundation we have established, CBBE has been able to move forward with its programming, including two educational networking events – on capital raising and business opportunities – so far this year.\n\nWhat should law students and other associates know about pro bono work at Davis Polk?\n\nAmber: There is such a strong emphasis on pro bono work from attorneys at all levels of the firm. As a more junior attorney, pro bono provides a great opportunity to take on a leadership role. I’ve taken advantage of the chance to work on a variety of pro bono projects, both litigation and now corporate; it’s been a great way to try my hand at something different and learn something new.",

That said, we had a pandemic and a lot of things going on since 2020.”\n\nMargaret also mentioned that other items on the agenda in 2023 include guidelines for bank mergers and resolution plans for regional banks. “2023 is going to be a pretty heavy year for the U.S. banking regulators,” she said.\n\n“What’s in store for 2023?

Counsel and head of Pro Bono Litigation Dara Sheinfeld discussed how Davis Polk became involved in the matter, which the firm is handling in partnership with Volunteers of Legal Service.\n\nFor Dara, this representation is close to home: She has known Sadik since moving to the neighborhood almost 20 years ago. She realized something was wrong when she saw Sadik’s newsstand closed down. “I saw that his newsstand was boarded up right away because I pass it to go to the subway every day,” she said. “And I was very confused. Because he’s always there. To see the stand closed–It’s never closed. It doesn’t matter what’s happening–Covid, a blizzard. He’s always open.”\n\nAfter Dara read an article about the closure, she reached out to the City Council member who had taken up Sadik’s cause, to ask if pro bono representation could help.\n\nAn interdisciplinary team of Davis Polk corporate, tax and litigation lawyers are working on the matter. “We really are just committed to learning what’s going on and trying to find a path forward to get him back in business,” Dara explained.\n\n“Heavy Hitter Lawyers Come to Aid of Embattled Newsstand Dealer,” The West Side Spirit (February 12, 2024)\n\nLearn more about Davis Polk’s Pro Bono program.",

And it’s unfair,” he said, noting that the businesses and people named in the government’s complaints are unable to defend themselves because they are not parties to the lawsuits.\n\n“This may never get decided. These tokens get named in a complaint, but these complaints may never actually go to trial. They might get settled. They might get dismissed for other reasons. There are all kinds of reasons why there may never actually be a decision on whether that token is a security,” Robert said.\n\n“Why a Former SEC Chief Is Calling the Agency’s Method in Recent Lawsuits ‘Not Fair,’” Unchained podcast (June 8, 2023)",

More recently, we are seeing some sponsors build in an ability to pivot to one or more of these mid-fundraising, if nec­essary, to the most efficient structure based on the actual breakdown of the investor base through multiple closings.”\n\nAs private credit funds explore a wider variety of product types, Chris noted, “Managers used to be terrified of the 40 Act and its restrictions – now we see start-ups launching BDCs either as a first step or at the same time as their first-time private funds. There is a growing trend in the market that most sponsors are going to want to have at least one access point for retail investors.”\n\n“Maximising credit fundraising agility in a competitive environment,” Private Debt Investor (March 3, 2025)",

Broadly, fundraising has been pretty subdued for the last few years, but the secondaries space has been one of the bright spots. I think that is because the opportunity set is strong there.”\n\n“Credit secondaries funds poised for growth,” Private Debt Investor (April 30, 2025)",

Then in 2018 we got a few tweaks, some of which need to be revisited.”\n\nIn terms of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act of 2018, which has been blamed in part for the recent bank failures because it raised the asset threshold at which a bank is regulated as a systemically important financial institution, Margaret said, “A common misconception is that the fix is an on/off switch for the 2018 tailoring rule, as sort of ‘that was bad, turn it off’, but it’s more complicated than that. Many of the regulations that applied to the banks that failed, were in fact, enacted during the Obama administration. One example is the AOCI [Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income] opt-out of 2013, which permitted regional banks not to take a hit on capital when their marketable securities lost value. It was increased in 2018 to a higher bank asset threshold, but that didn’t impact SVB.”\n\nShe said that while some rules do need to be tweaked, the real question that needs to be asked is how to improve supervision – much of which the public does not see. “Think of it as an iceberg with most of the action below the water line,” she explained.\n\n“The three reports from the Fed, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) make it clear that there is work to do in that area,” Margaret added.\n\n“Supervision could take spotlight in post-SVB reforms,” IFLR (June 1, 2023) (subscription required)\n\n",

It could also “open up opportunities for funds and other counterparties that do not normally enter into credit default swaps (CDS) or provide guarantees to enter into capital relief transactions with banking organizations by investing in CLNs instead.”\n\nThe FAQ clarifies that CLNs that are directly issued by the institution on its balance sheet would not automatically be recognized as synthetic securitizations under the capital rule. One reason is that a synthetic securitization must include a guarantee or credit derivative, which must be executed under standard industry credit derivative documentation.\n\n“[The direct CLNs] are executed using customary securities offering documentation of a disclosure statement and a note that reflects the terms,” Chris explained. “The notes would generally embed standard CDS credit event terms and definitions.”\n\nChris noted that following the FAQ, financial institution issuers may seek to discuss their CLN transactions with the Fed, including the types of underlying assets.\n\n“As long as the CLNs and their embedded CDS or guarantee terms meet the synthetic securitization requirements, there is no particular reason the underlying reference assets could not consist of a fairly broad range of loans or other credit assets,” he said.\n\n“Fed clarifies CLN treatment, approves MS deal,” Structured Retail Products (October 30, 2023) (subscription required)",

    "text": "The Davis Polk trial team that secured a ruling of no infringement on behalf of Comcast in patent litigation brought against the company by WhereverTV received runner-up honors in AmLaw Litigation Daily’s “Litigator of the Week” column. The team was led by partners Ashok Ramani and David Lisson, and included associates Serge A. Voronov, Kathryn Bi, Alena Farber, Micayla Hardisty and Elaine M. Andersen.\n\nWhereverTV sued Comcast in 2018 for patent infringement related to the integration of Netflix and other over-the-top apps onto Comcast’s X1 platform. Comcast denied infringement, explaining that WhereverTV’s patent (Global Interactive Program Guide Application and Device) covered an interactive program guide feature that Comcast never used. WhereverTV, which was funded by Longford Capital, asked for $177 million.\n\nOn April 26, 2023, after a one-week jury trial and minutes before closing arguments were to commence, Judge William Jung of the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida granted judgment as a matter of law of no infringement for Comcast.\n\n“Litigator of the Week Runners-Up and Shout Outs,” AmLaw Litigation Daily (April 28, 2023) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk client Monica Szlekovics was granted clemency in January 2020 after serving 23 years of a 50-to-life sentence, the result of an extensive clemency application and support from leaders of prominent domestic violence and women’s justice organizations throughout New York. Monica – a victim of severe domestic violence – used her time in prison to educate herself, counsel other women, and solidify her commitment to advocating for other victims of domestic violence.\n\nNow almost two years freed, Monica continues to build a new life for herself, which includes working full-time and drawing from her own experiences to support and promote educational opportunities for the incarcerated. Last month she traveled to Denver, Colorado where she represented Marymount Manhattan College Bedford Hills at the 11th Annual National Conference on Higher Education in Prison. She helped facilitate a workshop focused on re-envisioning the pedagogical structure and aim of higher education in prison communities, with an emphasis on peer-to-peer mentorship and inclusive horizontal coalition building.\n\nEarlier this year, we sat down with Monica to discuss her re-immersion into life outside of prison and her process for moving forward:\n\nNavigating life outside\n\n“I came home to a house full of people,” said Monica, now living in Rochester, NY, with her sister’s family, including five nephews. “They’ve been welcoming and supportive. It really afforded me the time to get acquainted with them in a way I hadn’t been able to because of the distance.” Monica is adjusting to her new day-to-day. Her sister helped her familiarize herself with two decades of technological and cultural changes, from smart phones to cashless grocery shopping. “It was a culture shock,” Monica said. “I can’t even say I’m starting over,” she said. “I’m starting.”\n\nApplying her skills\n\nWhile incarcerated, Monica gained nearly a decade of valuable experience managing the facility’s college program, in partnership with Marymount Manhattan College – also earning her bachelor’s degree with honors through the college. She built upon that role and now works as a paid program assistant for the facility’s college program, recently planning and executing a two-day conference. She also serves as an advisory committee member for the Survivors Justice Project, housed at Brooklyn Law School, which is a collective of formerly incarcerated women, attorneys, students and activists working together for the release or resentencing of domestic violence survivors. Monica recently graduated from Sanctuary for Families’ Economic Empowerment Program, a rigorous career readiness program, receiving certifications in Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint. This summer, she is doing a fellowship with the Frederick Douglass Project for Justice.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nOn the anniversary of Monica’s release, the Davis Polk team hosted a Webex meeting, where many who were instrumental in her clemency celebrated her first year of freedom. The team included Head of Pro Bono Litigation Dara Sheinfeld, associate Jennifer Kalmanides, former associates Peter Bozzo, Jaryn Fields and Brooklynn Moore, and former legal assistants Maya Kapelnikova and Emma Schwartz. Partner Tatiana Martins, counsel Denis McInerney and Special Counsel for Pro Bono Sharon Katz provided guidance. At this joyous event, Monica was joined by the lawyer who prosecuted her two decades before, the current District Attorney of Monroe County and attorneys from the Governor’s Clemency Bureau, who had reviewed her application – all promising her their continued support. During the meeting, Monica had a moving dialogue with her former prosecutor, speaking to him openly about how his words had shaped the way she viewed herself for 20 years, but also how his support for her clemency and belief in her transformation had helped her accept that she was worthy of forgiveness. “Seeing the support I had shifted my perspective about all that had happened,” Monica said. “It was the final piece I needed to move forward.”\n\nLearn more about Davis Polk’s Pro Bono program.",

    "text": "Davis Polk counsel Will Schisa was quoted in ABA Banking Journal discussing how international sanctions against Russia are impacting banks. “The last year has been all about Russia,” Will said, speaking at the December ABA/ABA Financial Crimes Enforcement Conference. “It’s really been an unprecedented sanctions effort in terms of its scale applied to a major world economy.”\n\nWill noted that “the U.K. and EU have put forth complex sanctions that take a lot to understand and don’t always overlap directly with U.S. sanctions.” A common complication, he said, stems from the three jurisdictions not being aligned on the Russian oligarchs they have designated and applying different approaches with respect to how sanctions flow down to undesignated entities owned or controlled by those listed persons. “Working through issues like that can be very complicated,” he said.\n\nRecognizing the complexity of sanctions, particularly outside the United States, Will noted, “For regional banks, the ultimate question may be whether they want to deal with this or simply de-risk” and exit the relationship.\n\nTurning to enforcement, except for clearly willful misconduct or the complete breakdown in a compliance program, Will said, the agency is unlikely to “play gotcha’,” recognizing it was a difficult year for banks and regulators alike. However, as the Russia situation stabilizes, banks will be expected to improve their sanctions-compliance effort, he said. “So the standard for compliance probably does become somewhat higher.”\n\nHe also mentioned that OFAC may be revamping its enforcement guidelines, which have not changed in more than a decade. Will said, “So OFAC wants to be sure they reflect current practice and they’re responsive to the public’s concerns—I think a good-government type of thing.”\n\n“New sanctions require banks to up their games,” ABA Banking Journal (March 23, 2023)",

    "text": "On June 17, 2025, Davis Polk secured a precedent-setting victory on behalf of our pro bono client Taylor Partlow, a survivor of life-threatening domestic violence. The New York Court of Appeals unanimously overturned Ms. Partlow’s conviction based on the ineffective assistance of her trial counsel. The Court’s opinion held that her trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to the prosecutor’s misconduct on summation. Davis Polk associate Corey Meyer argued the appeal before the Court of Appeals on April 8, 2025, with the entire team, Ms. Partlow and her parents in the courtroom.\n\nMs. Partlow was convicted of first-degree manslaughter in 2019 for stabbing her abusive boyfriend a single time during a domestic violence incident in which he had violently attacked her and was lunging at her again. At trial, justification was Ms. Partlow’s sole defense. During the prosecutor’s summation, in direct contradiction to what Ms. Partlow said on the stand, the prosecutor told the jury, “You never heard testimony that [the defendant] was in fear for her life.” Additionally, the prosecutor claimed Ms. Partlow had lied on the stand, using the word “lie” or “lies” 14 times. Ms. Partlow’s trial counsel did not object to the prosecutor’s false characterization of critical evidence or improper use of the word “lies.” The jury found Ms. Partlow guilty.\n\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeals, Ms. Partlow argued that her trial counsel provided ineffective assistance: first, by failing to request a jury charge on justification consistent with the Court’s precedent, and second, by failing to object to the prosecutor’s misconduct during trial. The Court of Appeals held that “counsel’s failure to object to multiple improper statements constituted a failure to provide meaningful representation, and under the circumstances of this case, denied the defendant the benefit of a fair trial.” The Court did not reach the jury charge issue.\n\nThe decision marks a rare instance of a conviction being overturned on the basis of prosecutorial misconduct, and it will serve as an important precedent for defendants seeking to challenge improper statements made by prosecutors at trial.\n\nThe Davis Polk team includes senior counsel Robert B. Fiske, Jr. and Denis J. McInerney, counsel and Head of Pro Bono Litigation Dara L. Sheinfeld, counsel Nikolaus Williams, associates Corey M. Meyer, Kathleen M. Lewis, Hugh Hansard Verrier, Nathaniel Cooney and Anna Fish, and former associate Sarah M. Bartlett.\n\nSteven Haber, Litigation and Pro Bono Counsel in Bloomberg L.P.’s Legal and Compliance Department, David Crow, Associate Appellate Counsel at Legal Aid Society, and Elizabeth Isaacs, Supervising Appellate Attorney at New York Indigent Legal Services’ Statewide Appellate Support Center, all provided invaluable assistance throughout the briefing process.",

Oscar Sanders.\n\nIn January 2018, Mr. Sanders was sentenced by the trial court to a term of 15 years to life in prison. After the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division affirmed the judgment, Davis Polk sought leave to appeal to the New York Court of Appeals. Following briefing, Davis Polk associate Chase McReynolds argued the appeal before the Court of Appeals on January 5, 2023.\n\nIn what the team believes is an issue of first impression nationwide, an opinion written by Judge Rivera held that the trial court violated Mr. Sanders’s due process rights by restraining him without formal explanation when the jury announced its verdict.  In addition to securing a new trial for our client, the decision reaffirms the longstanding constitutional prohibition against shackling criminal defendants during the guilt phase of trial in the absence of a special need, and for the first time expressly applies that prohibition to the verdict reading and jury polling.\n\nThe Davis Polk team, which was advised by the Legal Aid Society, includes Chief Pro Bono Counsel Amelia T.R. Starr, senior counsel Sharon Katz, partner Michael Flynn, associates Lesley Chen, Chris Combs, Chase McReynolds and Jessica Simonelli, and former associates Alex Bystryn and Ina Dogani.",

    "text": "Davis Polk AML/BSA head Dan Stipano was quoted in MoneyLaundering.com discussing a Department of Justice memo that marks a “very significant” change in posture by the government toward cryptocurrency exchanges.\n\nSpeaking about how the oversight of crypto will change following the memo, Dan said, “It’s a clear signal from the administration that, at least in terms of crypto enforcement policy, the targets of enforcement actions are not going to be crypto exchanges or crypto platforms, but rather the bad actors that transact through those exchanges around those platforms.”\n\nWhen asked what will happen to cases that the disbanded National Cryptocurrency Enforcement Team (NCET) was pursuing, Dan noted, “They’ll review the cases that are out there and make some decisions as to whether they want to continue to pursue them or not. But in this environment, it seems like there’s at least a decent chance that they will not pursue those cases.”\n\nDiscussing the regulation and enforcement of crypto from all agencies, he pointed out, “Regulation of crypto in general has been very spotty. It falls among several agencies and there’s no one agency that’s really tasked with it. It’s clear that under current leadership, the SEC is not going to be an aggressive regulator of crypto. FinCEN is woefully understaffed. The CFTC has a role to play, but again, I think the same policy is going to apply. The question I have is, what happens to the gatekeepers, the companies that actually provide access to the blockchain? It’s clear that the whole crypto area continues to be attractive to criminals and criminal organizations, so it’s very important from a policy standpoint that you have effective oversight.”\n\nEven with the change in policy, Dan believes that digital asset platforms will likely not reduce or eliminate their BSA efforts. “The responsible players in the crypto industry are not going to dismantle their AML programs,” he said. “They’ve invested a lot of time and money into those programs and they’re smart enough to realize that things change. We could have a Democratic-controlled Congress in two years. We could have a Democratic-controlled White House in four years. We could have another FTX at any time. Any of those things could change the environment very quickly.”\n\nPointing out the uncertainty around who will pursue money laundering charges involving crypto, Dan said, “I’m not really sure what’s going to happen because DOJ disbanded their crypto task force. You still have MLARS [Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section], at least for the time being. Will MLARS pursue these cases or will MLARS itself go away and get folded into another part of DOJ? It’s just an awful lot of uncertainty right now.”\n\n“DOJ Memo ‘Very Significant,’ But AFC Professionals Differ Over Its Impact,” MoneyLaundering.com (April 21, 2025) (subscription required)",

The proposed rule is broadly intended to bring the U.S. capital rules into conformance with the current version of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision’s (BCBS) international capital standards (the Basel Framework).\n\nThe letter highlights that the proposed rule suffers from a number of deficiencies, including stricter requirements that would make it more expensive for these U.S. banking organizations to engage in fundamentally important mortgage lending, small business lending and consumer financing activities.\n\nRead the letter here",

But that such a debate is not the ideal forum for addressing the key question of what entities should be able to engage in payments in the 21st century.\n\n“I make a clean break in my mind between the policy question of whether non-traditional banks, fintechs or payment companies should get master accounts - is that a good policy idea - and what the statute actually says,” Margaret notes said. “We’re having this legalistic fight when what we should really be asking ourselves is: Who should have access to a master account?”\n\nThe article notes that the Fed’s challengers will have to continue mounting a legal battle while also attempting to engage in banking without access to the nation’s payments system.\n\n“The Fed’s been playing the delay game, and so far they’ve done it really effectively,” she said. “So far, they’re winning.”\n\n“Will the Fed’s master account victories stand the test of time?” American Banker (April 4, 2024) (subscription required)",

Brian was honored in recognition of his longtime support of WhyHunger and his contributions to its Drum Together campaign.\n\nBrian, a Tony Award-winning producer, conceptualized and produced Drum Together. The campaign, which unites more than 100 of the world’s greatest drummers and percussionists for a drum-focused cover of The Beatles’ song “Come Together,” so far has raised nearly $600,000 to support WhyHunger’s community-led solutions around the globe that advance the human right to nutritious food for all.\n\nIn accepting the award, Brian said: “Bringing together so many amazing musicians for WhyHunger’s Drum Together was an absolutely incredible and inspirational experience. I’ve always been moved by Harry Chapin’s altruism. He walked the walk and paved a path for so many artists to do the same. I’m humbled to earn this award in his memory and legacy and look forward to continuing my support of WhyHunger’s work.”\n\nRead more about the award and Drum Together",

All that is about to change in 2023.”\n\nShe predicts that “banking regulation may finally have a full running course as many things are due to come out this year” and added that “banking regulators have a lot on their plate in 2023, with the finalization of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), scenario analyses for climate-related risks, as well as long-term debt requirements (or TLAC, which stands for total loss absorbing capacity) for large regional banks.”\n\n“2023: banking’s big year,” IFLR (January 17, 2023) (subscription required)",

Mario said he hopes the Tenth Circuit decision will not favor the “extreme version of the government’s argument” because any tax planning for a corporation or even a partnership would be vulnerable under the IRS’ reading of Section 7701.\n\n“That introduces an enormous amount of uncertainty,” Mario added.\n\nMario was also asked about the legal challenges to the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) beneficial ownership reporting requirement. He said that the case highlights privacy objections to requiring entities to report personal information of every owner of an entity to FinCEN and questions the proper role of the federal government to collect that kind of information.\n\n“It’ll be interesting to follow that [case],” he noted. “Certainly, it’s a headache to comply with those rules.”\n\n“Top Federal Tax Cases To Watch In 2025,” Law360 (January 1, 2025) (subscription required)",

One of the bright spots in deal activity. It had record deal activity last year, because if the need is liquidity, the market will find ways to provide liquidity.”\n\nSpeaking about how the firm has responded to the growth of private credit, he said, “We’ve built a huge finance business because we think this is where the world is going. If you think about where the firm is oriented, it is shifting in a lot of ways to prioritize private capital resources.”\n\n“Davis Polk’s Leor Landa on Wild Times in Fund Formation,” Legal Speak (February 14, 2025)",

    "text": "Davis Polk Restructuring co-head Damian Schaible and Restructuring partner and head of Liability Management & Special Opportunities Brian Resnick shared their thoughts on the 2024 bankruptcy outlook with Petition.\n\nLooking ahead to what the biggest themes of 2024 could be, Damian said, “Private Credit facilitating maturity extensions. As the 2025/2026 maturity wall gets closer, I expect to see even more sponsors look to private credit to facilitate maturity extensions. Expensive junior capital, often with equity attached, will be used to delever 1L debt to make it refinanceable.”\n\nBrian said, “Tighter Docs Lead to More Aggressive Liability Management Structures. Once document flexibility and loopholes get closed off — sometimes in connection with a liability management transaction or amend and extends — companies will be forced to get increasingly aggressive in finding leverage for negotiations. Never underestimate the creativity of smart lawyers to find novel structures and the market is learning that lending documents are rarely as tight as they look.”\n\nOf the $1.9 trillion in maturing commercial real estate debt over the next several years, Damian said, “Much of it will just continue to roll — either with maturity extensions or just sitting in default. Banks and lenders won’t want to own commercial buildings in a higher interest rate environment amidst great uncertainty for many city centers around the nation.”\n\nBrian added, “Lenders for the most part do not want to take back properties. While there will be some foreclosure and restructurings, we expect to see many “blend and extend” transactions. These are short term loan extensions granted in exchange for a modest rate increase and an infusion of new equity (often in the form of preferred equity).”\n\nOutside of the U.S., both Damian and Brian mentioned they expected to see distress in Europe. Damian noted that it is “closer to the macro issues in all respects — energy, wars, and shifting populations.”\n\nRegarding the firm’s talent priorities going into the new year, Damian said, “We are in continued, but responsible, growth mode, as we have been for several years. The opportunities for individual growth and development by junior lawyers in this market environment are truly exciting. There are a lot of complicated deals to get done, and junior lawyers are going to get to learn and lead a lot.”\n\nDiscussing the Purdue case before the Supreme Court, both Damian and Brian hope that the court affirms the Second Circuit. Damian said, “It’s so important that I hope the Court gets it right — widely supported and massively important third-party releases are critical in many cases.”\n\nBoth also agree that the economy is heading toward a soft landing in 2024. Damian noted, “Too much money has been raised and investors remain desperate to put it to work.”\n\nThinking about which U.S. industry will see the most amount of distress in 2024, they agreed on the healthcare industry. Brian said, “Even though people have been calling this for years, the thesis that the underlying model is broken seems right.”\n\n“Sponsors have loved it for awhile and have levered up many traditionally thin-margin companies in the sector,” Damian added. “Now wage inflation, rising rates and increasing and expensive regulatory developments are causing real issues.”\n\nWhen asked what the biggest restructuring controversy will be, Brian responded, “Opportunistic liability management transactions for relatively healthy companies, primarily to capture discount.”\n\nDamian said, “Governance of distressed companies – decisions made in the lead-up to restructurings that benefit sponsors and management to the detriment of funded debt creditors (and the decision-makers).”\n\nNoting what questions publications should be asking looking at the new year, Damian answered, “Will 2024 bring a wave of Restructurings or just tons of Liability Management?”\n\nBrian said, “How will direct lenders handle an uptick in defaults – will they be prepared to be aggressive with sponsors or will they focus on those relationships and be willing to sacrifice some returns in their defaulted credits?\n\n“BK Pros Weigh In.

He focuses on patent and trade secret litigation, and also has substantial experience handling complex commercial disputes. He comes to Davis Polk from Keker, Van Nest & Peters, where he was a partner in the Intellectual Property and Contract & Commercial practices.\n\nMr. Ramani has represented leading technology companies such as Comcast, Netflix, Hulu, HTC, Square and Broadcom. On behalf of defendant clients, in addition to pretrial victories, he has achieved complete victory after trial on multiple patents and mid-trial voluntary dismissal by the plaintiff. For his plaintiff clients, he has secured multiple nine-figure settlements and preliminary injunctions against former employees on trade secret misappropriation claims.\n\n“Ashok is a highly skilled and respected litigator with impressive first-chair trial credentials who will complement our terrific IP litigation team,” said Thomas J. Reid, Davis Polk’s Managing Partner. “We are delighted to welcome him to the firm.”\n\nDavis Polk’s intellectual property litigators are trial lawyers who have extensive experience handling patent infringement cases in courtrooms throughout the country. The firm also represents clients in disputes regarding trade secret misappropriation, trademark and copyright infringement, and false advertising. Clients turn to Davis Polk for counsel on preparing for potential IP litigation, IP enforcement and litigation avoidance, and benefit from the firm’s significant courtroom experience.\n\nAshok Ramani said, “Keker, Van Nest & Peters is a terrific firm and I am grateful for the 15 years I spent there learning how to try cases. But I have long been impressed by Davis Polk’s formidable litigators, and I am thrilled to join the team in Northern California and help to grow the IP litigation practice.”\n\n“Ashok is a tremendous addition to the firm,” said James P. Rouhandeh, head of Davis Polk’s Litigation Department. “He has an outstanding track record representing major technology companies in high-stakes IP disputes and will expand the resources available to our clients seeking premier IP litigation advice.”\n\nMr. Ramani received a B.A. in Economics from the University of California, Berkeley.

And that is somewhere we have seen focus again in the documentation, making sure that there is at least some flexibility on the underwriter’s part to unilaterally decide: we need to hit the bond market for some portion of this or we need to be able to pull some of that back into the loan market or change priority.”\n\nAddressing how the dynamic between the broadly syndicated loan market and direct lending changed this year, Jason noted, “One of the really fascinating things we’re seeing more now as the broadly syndicated markets have started to stabilize is that some of these direct lending deals are being refinanced before they even close, in broadly syndicated markets, using best-efforts financing.”\n\n“Direct Lenders Look for Protections Against Losing Deals: Q&A,” Bloomberg (April 21, 2023) (subscription required)",

Davis Polk’s pro bono team partnered with the New York Bar’s Office for Justice Initiatives, led by Deputy Chief Administrative Judge Edwina Mendelson, to assist the State Bar’s COVID Recovery Task Force in developing the initiative. It will provide remote legal assistance to the growing number of unrepresented New Yorkers who are filing child support petitions throughout the state in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nThe Davis Polk team, comprised of associates Alexa Lutchen and Elizabeth Weinstein, is led by Special Counsel for Pro Bono Sharon Katz and Pro Bono Counsel Dara Sheinfeld.\n\nThe full transcript of Judge DiFiore’s update can be found here.",

    "text": "Over the past year, Davis Polk has worked closely with the Brooklyn Public Library as it expands its community reach with the establishment of an innovative cultural hub, the L10 Arts and Cultural Center, set to open in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. In addition to a new library branch, the space will house outposts for four other prominent Brooklyn public institutions, offering gallery and performance space, cinemas and rehearsal studios.\n\nRestructuring partner Adam Shpeen has led our advisory work for the Library regarding its partnerships with Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Museum of Contemporary African Diasporan Arts and 651 ARTS. We advised the Library on real estate and corporate governance matters, such as the negotiation and establishment of an operating agreement with the other institutions, which governs how they will use the space as well as share common costs and building services. Adam also developed a close relationship with the Library’s General Counsel, Chloe Wasserman, who has involved the Davis Polk team in additional projects, including the review of an investment management agreement.\n\nAmong the lawyers on this team are a first, second and fourth-year associate. “Working on pro bono matters, and with the Brooklyn Public Library in particular, has been an invaluable training experience,” second-year Restructuring associate Kate Somers said. “As a junior associate, I’ve especially appreciated the opportunity to develop my corporate drafting skills, to actively participate on calls with the client and with the other legal teams involved, and to work collaboratively with the Davis Polk team. Aside from the fantastic skill development it provides, pro bono work has also been extremely rewarding. These engagements, whether they’re large-scale projects like the L10 Center or pro bono clinics that last a few hours, have a very real, very positive impact.”\n\nWe will continue to foster this community relationship with the Brooklyn Public Library, with the hope of becoming a go-to adviser and resource for its many legal needs in the realms of real estate, corporate governance, employee matters, IP, tax and beyond. Regarding his work with the Library, Adam said, “I live in Brooklyn and have three young kids who use the Library’s services. I feel a sense of attachment to the institution and find it rewarding to help a local organization that I walk past daily.”\n\n",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner and Capital Markets practice global chair Richard Truesdell was quoted in the American Lawyer on the outlook for the IPO market, in light of two high-profile IPOs pricing in the last week.\n\nRichard, who advised the underwriters on Arm’s nearly $5 billion IPO – the largest U.S. IPO since 2021 – explained, “While Arm was clearly unique, its success is clearly a significant step in bringing IPO investors back into the market. As a result, a number of our IPOs in the pipeline have either restarted or moved up their timeline. That being said, we don’t expect to see a broad recovery in the IPO market before Q1 2024,” he said.\n\nThe AmLaw article also highlighted Davis Polk’s role on multiple M&A, finance and capital markets transactions from the past week, including Comcast’s sale of spectrum to T-mobile, Finastra Group’s $5.32B refinancing – the largest-ever U.S. private credit deal, and debt offerings by Intuit, UBS, ING, Nestle, CaixaBank, Minerva and Advanced Energy Industries.\n\n“Deal Watch: With IPOs ‘In The Pipeline,’ Big Law Now Awaits Comeback,” American Lawyer (September 18, 2023) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner and Real Estate co-head Brian Lichter was quoted in Law360 on the 2008 recession and the state of the market in 2020 at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Brian noted that in September 2008, nearly every deal he was working on went “into a frenzy.” In contrast, he explained that in 2020, “there was a bit more of a drum beat leading up to the fallout from the pandemic in late February into March of 2020” and that “the market began to turn in the last week of February and then, as the news of spikes got worse, offices made quick preparations to close. At the time, I was working on a large refinancing where some in the lender group got skittish, but we were able to get them across the finish line and close.”\n\nBrian also explained that in 2020, “the capital markets were flying and investors were sitting on a lot of cash, so it wasn’t a question of whether there was money to do deals” and “the questions were more transformational — how will remote or hybrid work impact the office market in the future, where are people going to want to live going forward, what will the long-term impact be on business travel?”\n\n“The Best Of Times, The Worst Of Times: RE Attys Amid Crises,” Law360 (July 11, 2022) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk today announced that registered funds practitioner Christopher P. Healey has joined the firm as a partner in the Investment Management practice in Washington DC.\n\n“I am pleased to welcome Chris to the firm,” said Neil Barr, Davis Polk’s Managing Partner. “We are planning a material growth initiative in our asset management platform. Chris is a rising star in the registered funds space who brings deep market knowledge and significant experience in both transactional and regulatory work. In addition to addressing a strategic objective for our Investment Management practice, Chris is key to the buildout of our corporate presence in Washington.”\n\nMr. Healey advises clients on a wide array of registered fund products, including BDCs, closed-end funds and interval funds, as well as on complex asset management M&A transactions and innovative Investment Company Act regulatory matters. He has represented many of the leading sponsors and investment managers. Prior to joining Davis Polk, Mr. Healey was a partner in the Registered Funds practice at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP.\n\n“Chris has extensive experience advising a wide range of clients on registered fund and ‘40 Act matters. The diversity of his practice – from asset management M&A transactions for major investment firms, to representing clients with respect to various ‘40 Act products, to sophisticated regulatory work – aligns very well with what we do at Davis Polk,” said Leor Landa, head of Davis Polk’s Investment Management practice. “He is a fantastic addition to our team, and we are excited to welcome him.”\n\nMr. Healey said, “Davis Polk is an exceptional firm. The opportunity to join such a talented and collaborative group and help grow the firm’s asset management practice and Washington DC office is very exciting.”\n\nFund Intelligence named Mr. Healey a “Rising Star” at the 2020 Mutual Fund Industry and ETF Awards, and the Legal 500 US quotes a registered funds client describing Mr. Healey as a “key asset” with “tremendous ‘40 Act knowledge.”\n\nMr. Healey received his B.A. from Tufts University in 2006 and his J.D. from George Washington University Law School in 2011.",

    "text": "Washington DC, August 20, 2019 – Davis Polk today announced that Robert Cohen will join the firm as a partner in the Litigation Department in Washington DC.\n\nMr. Cohen will be a member of the firm’s White Collar Criminal Defense and Government Investigations Group, where he will focus on representing companies and boards in regulatory matters and internal investigations. He joins Davis Polk from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, where he served for 15 years in the Division of Enforcement, most recently as Chief of the Cyber Unit. During his tenure at the agency, Mr. Cohen was involved in significant enforcement actions involving securities fraud, insider trading, market manipulation and abuse, financial fraud, cryptocurrency and cybersecurity. His wide-ranging experience at the SEC and extensive knowledge of the financial markets and the cryptocurrency and cybersecurity fields will add further depth and strength to the firm’s premier white collar practice.\n\n“Rob will be a tremendous resource for our clients. He brings a unique mix of top-level SEC experience in multiple core enforcement areas,” said Neil Barr, Davis Polk’s Managing Partner. “He will further extend our legacy of prominence in the SEC enforcement space and joins an extraordinary team of former government officials in our Washington office, including litigators who have held high-ranking positions with the SEC, DOJ, FTC, White House and FBI.”\n\nDavis Polk has a long history of its lawyers serving with distinction in senior roles at the SEC, including former SEC Commissioner Annette Nazareth, former Managing Executive for Policy Joseph Hall and former SEC Enforcement Directors Gary Lynch and Linda Chatman Thomsen.\n\nAs the first-ever Chief of the Division of Enforcement’s Cyber Unit, Mr. Cohen supervised investigations concerning initial coin offerings and other conduct involving cryptocurrency, cybersecurity events, controls and disclosures at broker-dealers, investment advisers, stock exchanges and public companies, and cyber-related market manipulations.\n\nFrom 2015 to 2017, Mr. Cohen served as Co-Chief of the SEC’s Market Abuse Unit, supervising market structure and trading investigations, including violations by national securities exchanges, dark pools and large broker-dealers, complex insider trading, and large-scale manipulation.\n\nMr. Cohen was an Assistant Director in the Enforcement Division from 2010 to 2013. He joined the SEC in 2004.\n\n“Rob brings deep, multidisciplinary SEC enforcement experience and is held in the highest regard for his judgment and integrity, both by senior SEC staff around the country and the white collar bar,” said Neil MacBride, co-chair of Davis Polk’s White Collar Criminal Defense and Government Investigations Group. “Over his 15 years of public service, Rob’s enforcement actions ranged from securities fraud to insider trading to market manipulation to cybersecurity, all areas of importance to our clients.”\n\nRob Cohen said, “I am deeply grateful for the opportunities I have had to serve in government, and now I am thrilled to be joining Davis Polk. I have long respected and admired the firm, and look forward to working with the exceptional team in Washington to help clients navigate their most sensitive issues.”\n\nMr. Cohen received a B.S. from Cornell University in 1994 and a J.D. from New York University School of Law in 1997. He served as a law clerk to the Honorable Alexander Williams Jr. of the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland.\n\nWidely recognized as having one of the world’s preeminent white collar criminal defense practices, Davis Polk represents corporations and individuals from around the world in high-profile and complex matters, including government, grand jury and internal investigations. The firm’s litigators include some of the most highly respected criminal defense lawyers in the country.",

United States. The court ruled 7-2 that a provision of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act known as the “mandatory repatriation tax,” does not violate the Constitution, affirming a decision by the Ninth Circuit. The provision required U.S. taxpayers who owned shares in foreign corporations to pay a one-time tax on their share of the corporation’s earnings. The court emphasized that its ruling is narrow and limited in nature, and did not answer the question of whether a wealth tax would be constitutional. It is limited to: (i) taxation of the shareholders of an entity, (ii) on the undistributed income realized by the entity, (iii) which has been attributed to the shareholders, and (iv) when the entity itself has not been taxed on that income.\n\nMichael noted that campaigners against a wealth tax “got half a loaf.”\n\n“People are putting down stakes for the next case, and only one justice came out saying realization is not required. Four came out against,” he said.\n\n“US Supreme Court sidesteps wealth tax question in closely watched case,” Financial Times (June 20, 2024) (subscription required)",

At its broadest, it could apply to companies that market voluntary carbon offsets on a marketplace that is available to California residents.”\n\nGiven that the law would apply to entities operating within California, David added, “I think that the realistic and reasonable interpretation that companies should take is that it’s going to require some kind of actual business presence in California. That would mean you have regular sales in California, you have some kind of physical footprint in California.”\n\nDavid anticipates that the law may further the trend of companies walking back their emissions reductions claims. “I think companies might become even more guarded in their climate disclosures and net zero claims,” he explained. “They may not have really thought through whether those claims relate to Scope 1, Scope 2 or Scope 3 emissions or what those claims and commitments actually entail. We’ve seen some companies pull back from those claims and there might be a continuation of that trend.”\n\n“Stakeholders Divided Over Impact, Scope of California Voluntary Carbon Law,” OPIS (October 30, 2023) (subscription required)",

Single-stock futures are subject to regulation by both the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), though there are various special securities rules as well as exemptions for the instruments.\n\nThis joint oversight makes the regulatory structure “complex,” Zach said, noting that it may have contributed to their slow adoption. “Because these haven’t been offered in a while and OneChicago had limited success and closed years ago, it hasn’t been an area a lot of people have focused on.”\n\nWhile single-stock futures are listed on futures exchanges, these exchanges must “notice register” with the SEC as a stock exchange as well. This means they are subject to some, but not all, SEC requirements for exchanges, Zach explained. “I believe the CME actually notice-registered many years ago, and has rules for security futures, even though they don’t currently offer them.”\n\n“CME to launch single-stock futures,” Risk.net (December 12, 2024) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Michael Mollerus discussed the Supreme Court decision in Moore v. United States with Law360.\n\nThe court ruled 7-2 that a provision of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act known as the “mandatory repatriation tax,” does not violate the Constitution, affirming a decision by the Ninth Circuit. The provision required U.S. taxpayers who owned shares in foreign corporations to pay a one-time tax on their share of the corporation’s earnings. The court emphasized that its ruling is narrow and limited in nature, and did not answer the question of whether a wealth tax would be constitutional. It is limited to: (i) taxation of the shareholders of an entity, (ii) on the undistributed income realized by the entity, (iii) which has been attributed to the shareholders, and (iv) when the entity itself has not been taxed on that income.\n\nThe article notes that the court’s decision will likely not prevent lawmakers who are proponents of a wealth tax or a billionaire income tax from attempting to enact them.\n\n“I don’t think it will have a chilling effect,” Michael said. “I think the people that are in favor of a wealth tax or a billionaires’ tax think it’s constitutional and will probably go ahead and adopt it and see if the court strikes it down.”\n\n“Supreme Court Leaves Lifeline For Billionaire Income Tax,” Law360 (June 21, 2024) (subscription required)",

The four partners appeared between April 27 and May 18, 2023.\n\nMargaret Tahyar, head of Davis Polk’s Financial Institutions practice, noted how “unusual” it is to have four partners at one law firm testifying over a three-week period.\n\nMargaret testified before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy regarding recent bank failures. Partners David Portilla and partner Zach Zweihorn testified before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Digital Assets, Financial Technology and Inclusion, and partner Joe Hall testified before the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Commodity Markets, Digital Assets, and Rural Development, on the regulation of digital assets including stablecoins. The partners were invited to testify as lawmakers consider responses to crises in the crypto and regional banking spaces.\n\nBloomberg noted that Davis Polk has been a “go-to legal adviser during the recent banking crisis” and advises “major crypto players.”\n\nExplaining that each of the partners is viewed both as a leading lawyer in the area in which they were called to testify as well as a credible voice on both sides of the aisle, David noted, “We’re there to help make good policy. If we weren’t viewed in that way, I don’t think they would ask us.”\n\nAnd regarding digital asset regulation specifically, he noted, “there’s a potential for real consumer harm, unless there’s clear rules of the road in place.”\n\n“Davis Polk Hits Capitol Hill to Shape Crypto, Bank Regulation,” Bloomberg Law (May 22, 2023)",

    "text": "On September 17, 2024, our pro bono client, a sex trafficking survivor, was released from prison after serving nine years of a 25-year prison sentence in connection with the unintended death of an associate of her trafficker. Jackie (whose name has been changed for her privacy) was resentenced under the Domestic Violence Survivor’s Justice Act (DVSJA) – the New York State law that permits judges to consider the impact of domestic violence when sentencing an individual who was the victim of substantial abuse that was a significant contributing factor to the conduct that resulted in their conviction.\n\nUnder the DVSJA, the maximum sentence for Jackie’s crime is only five years. Having already served over nine years, Jackie’s September 16, 2024, resentencing in the Criminal Term of the New York County Supreme Court wiped out more than 15 years that were left on her original sentence and required her immediate release. This reduction is the most significant in a determinate sentence since the DVSJA’s enactment in 2019. Now connected to numerous organizations that provide critical re-entry support and therapeutic services, Jackie has great hope for her future.\n\nWhen Jackie was 19, she was targeted and groomed by a seasoned sex trafficker who used the “boyfriend model” to lure her to New York City and trap her. After several attempts, Jackie escaped and found safety with family and friends, who insisted on returning to the place of her trafficker’s operation to recoup some of the profits from her exploitation. A fight broke out and an associate of Jackie’s trafficker lost his life. Although it was understood that the man’s death was not intentional and resulted from the use of physical restraint by another person in the group, Jackie received the harshest sentence of the eight defendants on the theory that, but for Jackie, the group would not have returned to that location, and she was therefore responsible for the fight that resulted.\n\nDavis Polk began working with Jackie in 2020, ultimately spending over 2,000 hours investigating her case, collecting corroborating evidence, working with experts, preparing Jackie to meet with the District Attorney’s Office and engaging in extensive advocacy. The Legal Aid Society served as co-counsel, and the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office joined in the defense’s resentencing application.\n\nJackie joins 16 other criminalized survivors whom Davis Polk has helped in successful DVSJA-related cases or clemency petitions since 2019, along with co-counsel from Legal Aid, the Center for Appellate Litigation, New York County Defender Services, Sanctuary for Families and Brooklyn Law School, among others. Overwhelmingly, Davis Polk has achieved these victories for survivors through collaborative, non-adversarial engagement with District Attorneys’ Offices throughout the state, leading to over a dozen DVSJA motions in which the People have ultimately joined in our applications.\n\nThe Davis Polk team was led by senior counsel Denis McInerney and counsel and Head of Pro Bono Litigation Dara Sheinfeld, who together lead Davis Polk’s extensive efforts – which include successful clemency campaigns, criminal appeals and DVSJA litigation – on behalf of criminalized survivors. The team also included associates Stephanie Hansen, Jaclyn Katz and Jessica Paduganan and legal assistants Angelica Matoske and Kristina Milberger. Legal Aid Society Associate Appellate Counsel David Crow served as co-counsel, providing critical assistance.",

The new guidance urges banks to identify and mitigate their vulnerabilities to illicit funds and other financial crime risks stemming from their relationships with third parties such as fintech companies.\n\n“Bank-fintech partnerships have proliferated since the initial guidance was issued, and they [banks] have unbundled certain core banking activities like deposits, lending and payments, and made them available to consumers through fintech platforms,” Dan explained.\n\nHe also added that banks should include provisions in their contracts that enable them to carry out an audit or review of the fintech’s responsibilities to make sure they are being conducted properly.\n\nDan noted that previous enforcement actions from the OCC covered third-party risk generally. “There have been other enforcement actions that have touched on this, as well as supervisory actions that are not made public,” he said.\n\n“For Banks, New Guidance Means Reviewing, Reconsidering Fintech Partnerships,” MoneyLaundering.com (June 9, 2023) (subscription required)",

David explained that these structures involve lenders putting in a new financing secured by pari passu liens on the collateral that secures a company’s existing debt, along with separate standalone collateral that was previously unencumbered or that was dropped out of another creditor’s collateral package. The structures and documentation used to set up these transactions can be complicated and might include intercompany loans and bespoke intercreditor agreements. Often, they are set up to combine pockets of flexibility across multiple covenant baskets.\n\nDavid mentioned that along with more complex structures, borrowers are pushing lenders to sign more expensive non-disclosure agreements going into liability management negotiations with companies. “The provisions are becoming more aggressive in some cases and can include terms that have nothing to do with confidentiality at all. For example, lenders are in some cases pushed to sign these agreements before they have organized in a group or engaged counsel, and the draft agreements will include commitments to not join an ad hoc group, not sign a cooperation agreement and not challenge the legality of a transaction, sometimes for a period of a year or longer,” he said.\n\n“Liability management deals heat up amid widespread borrower stress,” Debtwire (February 2, 2024) (subscription required)",

Instead, they have great reputations, are institutional and have a strong relationship with a solid, steady investor base.”\n\nLeor also pointed out, “Investors in CDFs need to be able to both fund during likely distressed situations and to have access to capital at all relevant times because you never know when the conditions might get triggered and require capital contributions in short order.”\n\n“Contingent Dislocation Funds and Market Disruptions: Suitable Fund Participants and Potential Downsides to Avoid (Part Three of Three),” Private Equity Law Report (March 29, 2022) (subscription requited)",

Margaret noted that “The banks that do it [banking as a service] well have constant engagement with their fintechs” and that “you need someone at the end to hold the bag – and that’s always the bank. So the bank always needs to have visibility and awareness functions.”\n\nShe added that in terms of regulation, “It’s quite clear that [the OCC] is going to be doing a deep dive in examinations on fintech partnerships.”\n\n“What to Consider as Regulators Scrutinize Bank-Fintech Partnerships,” Bank Director (October 10, 2022)",

    "text": "Assisting nonprofit organizations is a major focus of our corporate and transactional pro bono practice. We recently worked with the Bay Area Furniture Bank, a California nonprofit that provides donated furniture and other goods to previously unhoused individuals and others who find shelter through local social service agencies. Most of its clients, without means to furnish their new spaces, sleep on the floor or don’t have a table to eat at before receiving donations. The Furniture Bank says its mission is “furnishing futures” – our team was honored to help the group secure its own. Learn more from Harshil Shukla, Pro Bono Attorney for Corporate & Transactional Matters, and Henry Hawkins, a second-year Litigation associate in our Northern California office.\n\nHow did our lawyers get involved with the Furniture Bank?\n\nHarshil: Nancy Marchand, our Head of Corporate & Transactional Pro Bono, learned through her connections in the pro bono counsel community that the Furniture Bank was looking for assistance on a potential strategic alliance. We first connected with the Furniture Bank’s founder and executive director, Ray Piontek, in April of 2022. After a long and successful business career, Ray, in his retirement years, created the Furniture Bank and made it his personal mission to supply people in need with furnishings to turn their new houses into homes. Ray, at age 79, was still doing much of the day-to-day work himself. He and his board were looking to partner with another organization that could help sustain the Furniture Bank and its mission as Ray sought to transition away from the grind of running daily operations.\n\nWhat did our work for the Furniture Bank entail?\n\nHarshil: Ray and the Furniture Bank’s board had decided to expand and formalize the group’s existing relationship with Abode Services, a larger nonprofit fighting homelessness and providing homes for the unhoused. As on a billable M&A matter, we first did diligence work to understand the two organizations. We were involved in meetings with both boards and conversations in which the leaders of both groups talked about their goals for the partnership. After drafting and securing agreement on a preliminary term sheet, we moved on to drafting the strategic alliance agreement and other ancillary agreements. We got to be not only legal counsel but strategic advisers that the Furniture Bank board really relied on.\n\nHenry, what specifically did you work on for the Furniture Bank?\n\nHenry: I helped a lot with drafting the strategic alliance agreement. Arrangements of this nature are not formed very often, so I did a lot of it from scratch and by adapting elements of other agreements. I also helped revise the Furniture Bank’s governing documents. In meetings with the Furniture Bank’s board, I helped explain complex legal language and structures to nonlawyers.\n\nWhat has been most meaningful to you about our work for the Furniture Bank?\n\nHarshil: A couple of months into our work, we learned that Ray was very sick and realized that this was driving the need to solidify the Furniture Bank’s future. He continued to be very involved in the project and, thankfully, got to see that we were almost at the finish line before he died in October 2022.\n\nThe work became quite personal for our team because we knew how much this meant to Ray. There was so much on the line for Ray’s legacy, as well as for individuals and families in need.\n\nHenry: In addition, the homelessness crisis in the Bay Area is catastrophic – it’s among the worst in the country. Against this dire backdrop, the impact of the Furniture Bank’s work is so tangible. It was rewarding to help ensure this life-changing aid will continue to be available to people who need it for years to come. And hearing from the board how much they appreciated our help was really satisfying.\n\nWere there other Davis Polk lawyers who worked on this project?\n\nHarshil: In addition to Nancy, Henry and me, the team included partners Stephen Salmon (Corporate, Northern California), Mario Verdolini (Tax, New York) and Kyoko Takahashi Lin (Executive Compensation, New York), associate Sheryl Bohan (Executive Compensation, New York), and 2022 summer associates Jared Madnick and Michael Allen Nakamura.\n\nWhat should law students and other associates know about pro bono work at Davis Polk?\n\nHenry: Pro bono work is a really fantastic way to hone your legal skills and develop new ones. As an associate in my first and second years, I got to do bespoke drafting, which was a confidence builder. And you can get a lot of client contact on a pro bono matter. As we were finalizing the strategic alliance, the Furniture Bank’s board chair, Richard Gross, called me directly on multiple occasions to talk through issues and provisions. It was really nice to have that rapport.\n\nLearn more about Davis Polk’s Pro Bono program.",

    "text": "In 2011, Davis Polk began our representation of Nancy Smith, a Head Start school bus driver who was wrongfully convicted in 1994 of sexually abusing preschool students who rode her bus. Nancy, a single mother of four, was sentenced to 30-90 years in prison, leaving her children to grow up without her.\n\nNancy’s conviction – multiple counts of rape, attempted rape and gross sexual imposition – was part of a sensationalist wave of “day care sex abuse” cases that swept across the United States in the 1980s and early 1990s. The case was instigated by a Lorain County, Ohio, parent who had created hysteria in her community in the midst of nationwide panic about fantastical accusations concerning ritual sex abuse that targeted young children. Through communications with the press and efforts to influence other parents and their children to make accusations, the fear she sparked led to a witch hunt. Nancy and her co-defendant were ultimately convicted in the absence of any physical evidence that the children involved in this case had ever been abused, let alone in the manner alleged. Nancy’s appeals and efforts to obtain post-conviction relief were unsuccessful, and her attorney at the time failed to file a timely habeas corpus petition in federal court.\n\nFourteen years later, an unusual procedural defect in her sentencing order led to another review of Nancy’s case, including evidence never presented to the jury that convicted her. Upon this second look, the reviewing judge acquitted Nancy and her co-defendant, releasing them both from prison in 2009.\n\nWe became involved in Nancy’s case through the Ohio Innocence Project and not long thereafter, the Ohio Supreme Court ruled in 2011 that the judge who acquitted her did not have jurisdiction. The ruling meant that she would need to complete the remaining 15-75 years of her prison sentence, yet no action was taken to schedule a resentencing hearing or re-incarcerate her. Nancy was left in limbo – she continued to rebuild her life at home despite the ever-present threat of being returned to prison.\n\nAs we worked to resolve the case, Nancy’s plight gained national attention and was featured on NBC’s Dateline and CNN’s Anderson Cooper 360°. We filed an application with the Governor of Ohio for commutation of her sentence or pardon. The then-Lorain County Prosecutor was supportive of commutation.\n\nIn 2013, while we waited for action from the Governor, the Ohio Supreme Court, pursuant to its 2011 directive, assigned the matter to a new judge and mandated that Nancy return to prison. However, we reached an agreement with the Lorain County District Attorney that ensured Nancy would never return to prison. She also would not have to register as a sex offender, and could continue to pursue her application for a pardon.\n\nNancy finally achieved justice this year. On February 25, motions filed for a new trial were granted. The motions were based upon newly discovered evidence; the parent who had instigated the action against Nancy is now engaged in a similar pattern of behavior targeting a member of her own family. Additionally, significant flaws in the original investigation were revealed in light of the advancements made since 1994 in techniques for properly interviewing children and investigating sex crimes against them.\n\nThe guilty verdicts had always been notoriously controversial and the current Lorain County District Attorney campaigned on a pledge to reinvestigate the case. Once the new trial was granted, he announced he would not seek to retry the defendants because his investigation had concluded – as Nancy had always proclaimed – she was innocent. In fact, no crime had ever been committed. All of the charges against Nancy Smith and her co-defendant were dismissed.\n\nMany members of the Davis Polk community worked on Nancy’s case over the last 11 years. Our team included senior counsel and former Special Counsel for Pro Bono Sharon Katz, former senior counsel James W.B. Benkard (deceased), former Special Counsel for Pro Bono and U.S. District Judge Hon. Ronnie Abrams, counsel Brett M. McMahon, former counsel Nancy B. Ludmerer, associates Lindsay Schare and Jason H. Sugarman, former associates William D. Pollak, Samir Kaushal, Justin Sommers, Erika Vignoli, Britt Kovachevich, Ina Dogani, Korey Boehm and Hunter Books Mims, law clerk Madeleine Vera Wykstra, senior legal assistant Edgar Bernard Halford, and former legal assistant Tracy M. Wright.",

    "text": "On June 2, 2023, Davis Polk partner and Restructuring co-head Marshall Huebner and Civil Litigation partner Ben Kaminetzky were featured as the AmLaw Litigation Daily’s “Litigators of the Week” for securing final approval of Purdue Pharma’s chapter 11 plan of reorganization.\n\nOn May 30, 2023, in a landmark 83-page opinion, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court on all issues and affirmed the original opinion of the Bankruptcy Court confirming Purdue Pharma’s chapter 11 plan. The Second Circuit exhaustively reviewed the law and set forth a new seven-factor test for evaluating third-party releases.\n\nPurdue is one of the largest and most complex mass tort cases in U.S. history – and with the largest claims pool of any bankruptcy in U.S. history. Davis Polk began working with Purdue in 2018 to overhaul the company’s governance and craft a comprehensive resolution of more than $40 trillion of asserted claims.\n\nExplaining the importance of the case, Marshall said, “As much was at stake in this case as any in which I have been involved in over 30 years of practice. 100% of all distributions under the plan are required to go to opioid abatement and victim compensation. And those distributions—$5.5-$6 billion in cash from the Sacklers, and 100% of Purdue’s cash and valuable operating assets—are very material, and have the potential to improve, and in some cases even save, tens of thousands of American lives.”\n\nDiscussing the most significant issues litigated during the course of this bankruptcy, Ben said, “Even putting the layers of appeals aside, there were dozens of litigated issues in the 44 months since the cases were filed, which is not surprising in a case of this scope and notoriety—with over $40 trillion of claims filed by over 614,000 parties. But two litigations certainly stand out: The first is the preliminary injunction we filed in the first days of the case that stayed all the pre-petition litigation. It served as the backbone of the case by forcing all public and private stakeholders to the table to negotiate a comprehensive plan. The second was the contested confirmation hearing during the pandemic. This was a remote, multi-week trial with 41 witnesses and oral argument on countless statutory and constitutional issues.”\n\nReflecting on reaching this milestone in the case, Marshall noted, “It is the victims and other stakeholders for whom I and Davis Polk have been working for more than five years, and it is mission-critical that we get this company’s assets out of Chapter 11 as soon as possible to put the allocated billions to work to help with the opioid crisis. Eighty-three pages of complete and total vindication on the law was gratifying, but it is all of very little moment unless and until the dollars and lifesaving medicines are flowing to those in desperate need.”\n\n“I am just so proud of the extraordinary effort of our team,” Ben added. “To get to where we are today, this case required unprecedented creativity, patience, thick skin, focus—and crushingly hard work.”\n\nA true team effort, many lawyers from across the firm played a pivotal role in achieving this result. Restructuring partners Eli Vonnegut and Angela Libby, counsel Chris Robertson and associates Dylan Consla, Stephanie Massman and Jake Weiner and Civil Litigation partner Jim McClammy, counsel Marc Tobak and associates Kathryn Benedict and Garrett Cardillo were also recognized in the article.\n\n“Litigators of the Week: Davis Polk Gets 2nd Circuit Blessing for Purdue Pharma’s Multibillion-Dollar Bankruptcy Settlement,” AmLaw Litigation Daily (June 2, 2023)",

    "text": "Davis Polk was featured in a pair of Bloomberg Law articles in connection with its role as one of the industry’s top legal advisers responding to the current banking crisis. The firm is involved in multiple major assignments, including advising UBS on its $3.2 billion acquisition of Credit Suisse and advising 11 of the largest U.S. banks in making $30 billion in uninsured deposits into First Republic Bank.\n\nDavis Polk Chair and Managing Partner Neil Barr told the publication, “Teams from across our entire firm – from restructuring to financial regulation to M&A and finance, and a host of other groups – came together when this all started and have been working non-stop since then to advise clients in real-time as this situation continues to unfold and evolve.”\n\nPartner and Financial Institutions practice head Margaret Tahyar was highlighted for her work advising Signature Bridge Bank on various legal, regulatory and corporate governance matters related to its creation, operation and exit from bridge bank status, as well as Silicon Valley Bridge Bank on a range of issues relating to its status as a bridge bank and ending with the acquisition of substantially all of its deposits and certain assets by First Citizens.\n\n“They want to see lawyers who’ve done it before and they want to see battle scars,” she said of the fact that so many of the lawyers involved in the 2008 financial crisis are taking lead roles in the current situation. “Bridge banks are something that most normal lawyers never think about and we’ve got a whole crew here at Davis Polk who have spent 11 years thinking about bridge banks.”\n\nWhen asked about Federal Reserve Chairman Powell’s comments that the central bank needs to strengthen supervision and regulation in light of the banking crisis, Margaret agreed and explained, “What I think needs to happen next is a rethinking of how supervision does its work and a paradigm shift of what is transparent and not transparent to the market. The supervisory staff needs more resources and more technology. They are doing heroic work but need better tools.”\n\nDavis Polk partner and Restructuring practice co-head Marshall Huebner, referred to by Bloomberg Law as “a key architect of the 2008 bailouts,” stated, “The current issues are serious and should not be minimized, but, unlike 2008, nobody thinks that the entire western financial system is in immediate and mortal peril.”\n\nAs for Marshall’s current role advising SVB’s bondholders, among other mandates, “there have been 18-hour days, one after another,” he said. “There are rather few lawyers who understand and have experience with the tremendous interactive complexity between the bank regulatory system and bankruptcy system.”\n\nBloomberg Law also notes that Marshall, a new grandfather, took many client calls from his daughter’s hospital room over the weekend that the first news of Silicon Valley Bank broke. “There’s virtually no place that we can’t be found when our clients need us,” he said.\n\nBloomberg Law also highlighted Davis Polk’s critical role in responding to the 2008 financial crisis. Marshall was recognized for his role as lead counsel to the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve in the rescue of AIG, which Bloomberg Law noted was “the largest government bailout of a private company in U.S. history.” Partner and Financial Institutions practice Chair Randall Guynn, who advised the 11 banks on the First Republic matter, was called out for his role leading all of Citigroup’s major crisis matters.\n\n“Bank Crisis Has Wall Street Legal Vets Reprising Top Roles,” Bloomberg Law (March 27, 2023) (subscription required)\n\n“Davis Polk Leads Silicon Valley Bank Sale to First Citizens,” Bloomberg Law (March 27, 2023) (subscription required)",

And if you can do it out of court, you can save a lot of money for the investors.”\n\n“I think the entire restructuring community is busy right now,” Damian said. “You have 2024 maturities that are not looking like they are so easy to finance and companies will have to deal with them. During COVID, everyone stuffed their cheeks, and that liquidity is starting to die out and that means the market is much busier.”\n\nHe said that he expects to see an increase in “bootstrap M&A” in 2023 due to companies being “overleveraged, but not distressed.”\n\n“Sponsors can’t refinance in a regular way, and they don’t want to default,” Damian continued. “They are willing to put new money in, but they want an extended runway.”\n\n“Deals or Bust: Corporate Lawyers Map Out Path Ahead for 2023,” American Lawyer (March 23, 2023) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk’s trial victory and unanimous jury verdict in favor of Meta and WhatsApp, ordering NSO Group to pay $168 million in damages for its 2019 spyware attack targeting WhatsApp, were recognized in the Daily Journal’s weekly Verdicts & Settlements section, which honors recent notable verdicts and settlements. The Davis Polk team was led by partners Greg Andres, Antonio Perez-Marques and Micah Block.\n\nThe jury’s verdict marked another landmark in a case originally filed in October 2019, after Meta and WhatsApp engineers discovered a sophisticated exploit attacking WhatsApp’s servers in May 2019. Meta and WhatsApp identified NSO Group as the source of the attack, and determined that NSO‘s victims included journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents and others. \n\nThe jury trial, which was to decide the amount of damages that NSO Group owed Meta and WhatsApp, began on April 28, 2025 in Oakland, California. The six-day trial included groundbreaking testimony from NSO Group executives, who admitted that they used WhatsApp to install spyware on the mobile devices of up to tens of thousands of individuals, and continued to use WhatsApp to install spyware even after WhatsApp and Meta filed their complaint. The jury returned a unanimous verdict in favor of Meta and WhatsApp, ordering NSO Group to pay $167,254,000 in punitive damages and the full requested amount of $444,719 in compensatory damages. In awarding punitive damages, the jury found that NSO Group acted with malice, oppression or fraud in violating the CDAFA.\n\nThe case marks the first jury verdict against a commercial spyware company in U.S. court, and is the first U.S. verdict against NSO Group, which was added to the Department of Commerce Entity List for activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States in November 2021. The case is also the largest ever reported verdict in a civil case brought under either the CFAA or the CDAFA. \n\nThe Davis Polk team also included counsel Gina Cora, Craig T. Cagney and Andrew Yaphe, associates Esther C. Townes, Luca Marzorati, Muhammad Sardar, Gersham Johnson, Quentin J. Ullrich, Amelia Birnie, Kaitlin Campanini, Meenu Mathews and Cyerra Haywood, law clerks Tyler Conroy and Thomas Floyd and senior paralegal Felicia Yu.\n\n”Verdicts and Settlements: Whatsapp Inc., Facebook Inc. v.

He expects continued difficulties in real estate, healthcare and retail.\n\nHowever, Damian said that there is also cause to predict a drop in filings. “On the other side, interest rates are coming down, and the stock market has been ripping.”\n\nHe added that other points of interest to watch out for are attempts to avoid creditor-on-creditor conflict in out-of-court restructurings and the possibility of litigation over “double dip” transactions involving intercompany loans between affiliates using borrowed money.\n\n“Bankruptcy Issues To Watch In 2025,” Law360 (January 1, 2025) (subscription required)",

Paying more than you have to pay to manage the capital structure is not in the company’s best interest.”\n\n“Emboldened Junk Borrowers ‘Shave Pennies’ With Tenders on Cheap,” Bloomberg (February 29, 2024) (subscription required)",

    "text": "A Davis Polk team led by partners Jim Rouhandeh, head of the firm’s Litigation Department, Tony Perez-Marques and Lara Samet Buchwald received runner-up honors in AmLaw Litigation Daily’s “Litigator of the Week” column for securing a victory for ExxonMobil in litigation concerning the tax treatment of a 2006 transaction with the State of Qatar.\n\nAfter a weeklong trial in April 2024, Chief Judge David C. Godbey of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas issued a post-trial decision on October 31, 2024, holding that ExxonMobil was lawfully entitled to claim the interest expense deductions that were disallowed by the Internal Revenue Service and that were at issue in the case.\n\nThe litigation concerned a partnership between ExxonMobil and the State of Qatar called Al Khaleej Gas. Al Khaleej Gas was formed in 2000 to develop and market valuable minerals in the North Field, the largest non-associated gas field in the world. In 2006, the parties amended their original agreement that governed the partnership to significantly expand its production capacity, making it large enough to generate electricity sufficient to power the equivalent of approximately eight million homes in the United States on an average day.\n\nAs part of that amended agreement (and as one of many changes to the partnership), the parties incorporated a production payment. The production payment, which is a form of financing that is commonly used in the petroleum industry, recapitalized the State of Qatar’s equity interest in the partnership. Rather than taking solely a profit share (as was the case under the original agreement), the State of Qatar took a reduced profit share and a production payment. Under the terms of the production payment, the State of Qatar received regular quarterly payments of principal and interest on a fixed schedule and at a market rate of interest – payments that were made out of production and that did not depend on whether the partnership was profitable.\n\nBeginning in 2006, ExxonMobil deducted from its income the interest portion of those payments. The Internal Revenue Service disallowed the interest expense deductions, ruling that the production payment did not qualify for treatment as a mortgage loan under section 636(a) of the Tax Code. ExxonMobil filed suit in March 2022 to recover (among other things) taxes, penalties and interest that were erroneously collected by the government in connection with ExxonMobil’s tax treatment of Al Khaleej Gas for tax years 2010 and 2011.\n\nIn its post-trial decision, the Court held that ExxonMobil was entitled to the interest expense deductions for multiple, independent reasons, adopting virtually all of ExxonMobil’s arguments.\n\nThe Davis Polk team also included associates Sean Stefanik, Kyra Macy Kaufman, Kamali Houston, Kathleen Lewis, Alyssa Metcalf and Kaitlin Campanini.\n\n“Litigator of the Week Runners-Up and Shout-Outs,” AmLaw Litigation Daily (November 22, 2024) (subscription required)",

Joe noted that Congress failed to establish clear regulatory jurisdiction over cryptocurrency spot markets and trading platforms. “Congress really should have acted before now,” he said. “These assets have been around now for a decade. They briefly reached a $3 trillion market capitalization, and it’s crazy to think that we had that much wealth in a market that is basically not regulated. It just doesn’t make any sense at all.”\n\nJoe also explained, “A comprehensive market regulator, like the SEC or like the CFTC, could pretty quickly put in place a regulatory regime that would prevent trading market blow-ups like this. It’s not going to be able to get rid of Ponzi schemes, rug pulls and garden-variety fraud in the market, but the SEC and the CFTC do a very good job of regulating basic market infrastructure. That’s what was missing here.”\n\n“As FTX burned, lawmakers said to be dithering over regulator,” Roll Call (November 29, 2022)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner and Corporate practice head Michael Kaplan, partner and Capital Markets practice co-head John Meade and partner and Derivatives & Structured Products practice head Mark Mendez were named 2025 “Dealmakers of the Year” by the American Lawyer in connection with their roles leading the underwriters on Boeing’s $24.25 billion common and depositary share offerings, which was the largest-ever U.S. follow-on equity offering.\n\nIn October 2024, Boeing registered for and announced its intention to issue billions worth of common stock and mandatory convertible preferred stock. Davis Polk was brought in as underwriter counsel by Kirkland & Ellis, Boeing’s lead counsel on the matter. The offering was marketed over the course of a weekend and was ultimately oversubscribed.\n\n“I think we were perceived as a firm that could help get this done,” Michael explained.\n\n“What we were able to bring to the table was deep experience and the fluency we have with all the issues that came together … You can give us all the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle, and we’ll make them fit,” John added.\n\nWith Boeing issuing both common and preferred stock, the transaction involved a complex structuring. “While the mandatory convertible preferred [stock] using depositary shares is not a brand new product, it’s exotic and thus complicated for any issuer, especially on a short timetable,” Mark said.\n\nJohn noted that the ongoing media attention Boeing received throughout the process added “an expectation of success,” which also complicated the deal. “We often do offerings that make the front page, but this was daily speculation.’\n\n“Our job is always to get everything right,” Michael said, “but given the public focus on this one, you just can’t afford a misstep on something like this.”\n\nAmerican Lawyer’s 2025 “Dealmakers of the Year” were announced on March 19, 2025.\n\nRead the profile",

He also shares his thoughts on the extent to which the UK’s capital markets reforms have altered the perception of public listing.\n\n“I guess we all look back to the highs and busyness of the second half of 2021 and we all point to that in terms of what ideal activity would look like, where you’ve got the double whammy of both the volume of deals but also the value of the deals,” Will said. “I think from the low point of the end of 2022, things have gradually come back over the last 18 months.”\n\nThe interview touches on some of the themes that will be discussed at City & Financial Global’s M&A Summit on October 21, 2024, which Will is chairing.\n\nWatch the full interview",

The award honors the lawyers who “brought expertise, creativity and profoundly hard work to bear” to create success for their clients, further solidifying well-earned reputations for excellence.”\n\nNeil and Brian were recognized for their role leading the Davis Polk team that advised Josh Harris and partners on the $6.05 billion acquisition of the Washington Commanders NFL franchise. The acquisition was the largest price ever paid for a professional sports franchise.\n\nBrian highlighted that given the unique circumstances of the sale, “there was intense media scrutiny around the entire sales process,” which complicated the deal. “Our group was so personally invested in making sure this deal gets done, personally and for the community, and trying to keep our eye on the prize,” he said.\n\nAdditionally, Louis, Oliver and Shanu were recognized for their work advising ExxonMobil on its $59.5 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources. The transaction was the largest deal globally in 2023.\n\nWhile the team was presented with several obstacles throughout the negotiations, that was eased by Davis Polk’s longstanding relationship with Exxon. Louis, Oliver and Shanu also advised Exxon in 2023 on its multi-billion-dollar acquisition of Denbury, and for decades the firm has advised Exxon on major transactions, including its $81 billion acquisition of Mobil in 1999.\n\n“Having worked for this client for so long, relationships have grown [with] understanding of their business,” Louis explained.\n\nAmerican Lawyer’s 2024 “Dealmakers of the Year” were announced on March 20, 2024.\n\nRead the profiles",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner and Investment Management head Leor Landa was quoted in Private Equity Law Report on contingent dislocation funds and their unique features. One feature is the dormancy period in which funds remain inactive until a dislocation event occurs. Leor noted that there is a broad spectrum of dormancy periods, with most lasting approximately two or three years. Leor also pointed out that some CDFs are activated in manager’s sole discretion. “If you trust your sponsor – which you must if you’re willing to give it a contingent commitment – then why would you stand in its way?” he said.\n\n“Contingent Dislocation Funds and Market Disruptions: Unique Mechanisms That Position Them to Pounce (Part Two of Three),” Private Equity Law Report (March 22, 2022) (subscription required)",

Partner Elliot Moskowitz accepted the award on behalf of the firm.\n\nFollowing the October 7th attack on Israel, anti-Jewish protests emerged on college campuses nationwide, including at UCLA, where protesters set up a “Jew Exclusion Zone” that barred Jewish students and faculty from key parts of campus. In granting the students’ motion for a preliminary injunction in their federal lawsuit against the university (Frankel v. Regents of the University of California), district court Judge Mark C. Scarsi called the exclusion of Jews on UCLA’s campus “unimaginable” and “abhorrent to our constitutional guarantee of religious freedom.”\n\nDavis Polk is partnering with Becket and Clement & Murphy in this pro bono matter to defend and protect Jewish students and faculty.\n\nLearn more about Davis Polk’s Pro Bono program.",

    "text": "Washington DC, January 4, 2021 – Davis Polk today announced that Daniel Stipano has joined the firm as a partner in the Financial Institutions Group in Washington DC. Mr. Stipano is widely recognized as a leading practitioner in Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering (BSA/AML) and enforcement matters.\n\nMr. Stipano’s extensive bank regulatory and enforcement experience includes more than 30 years at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC). As Deputy Chief Counsel from 2000 to 2016, he oversaw the OCC’s major enforcement actions up until the time of his departure. He also played a key role in significant BSA/AML rulemakings and policy issuances following the enactment of the USA PATRIOT Act. From 1995 to 2000, Mr. Stipano served as Director of the OCC’s Enforcement & Compliance Division.\n\n“Dan offers the key government experience in the BSA/AML advisory and enforcement space that our clients value. He will be a tremendous asset to our preeminent financial institutions and white collar teams,” said Neil Barr, Davis Polk’s Managing Partner. “We are pleased to welcome him to the firm.”\n\nMr. Stipano’s practice includes representing clients in state, federal and foreign banking enforcement actions, and providing assistance in establishing, maintaining and monitoring BSA/AML compliance programs.\n\nWhile at the OCC, he supervised more than a dozen successful appeals, and was instrumental in bringing both the first fair lending action taken by a federal banking agency against a bank and the first Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices (UDAP) action taken against a bank. Mr. Stipano has testified six times before Congress on enforcement and BSA/AML matters, and also prepared OCC witnesses for testimony in this area.\n\n“Dan has built a leading practice in both bank regulatory and BSA/AML enforcement work and is incredibly well respected in the market,” said Meg Tahyar, Co-Head of Davis Polk’s Financial Institutions Group. “As BSA/AML enforcement continues to intensify, Dan’s deep understanding of the area and strong relationships with regulatory agencies will be incredibly valuable.”\n\nDaniel Stipano said, “Davis Polk’s reputation in bank regulatory and white collar work is second to none. I am excited to join the firm and look forward to working alongside my new colleagues on significant BSA/AML investigations and enforcement matters.”\n\nRecognized by Chambers USA as a leading lawyer in Financial Services Regulation: Banking (Enforcement & Investigations), Mr. Stipano has spoken at hundreds of conferences and industry events. He received his J.D. from William & Mary Law School in 1983 and B.A. from Union College in 1980.\n\nAbout Davis Polk.\n\nDavis Polk & Wardwell LLP (including its associated entities) is an elite global law firm with world-class practices across the board.

    "text": "Davis Polk lawyers have provided pro bono support to American military veterans for many years, with a focus on administrative appeals concerning benefits. We have recently expanded this initiative through a new partnership with the Veterans Consortium – our lawyers are handling disability benefits appeals before the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) and discharge upgrade applications on behalf of veterans suffering from mental illness.\n\nOur most recent case was the representation of a Korean War veteran with a medical disability stemming from exposure to herbicides (including Agent Orange) during his service overseas. Although our client knew he had been exposed to Agent Orange while stationed in Korea and an independent medical opinion concluded that his medical issues were more likely than not the result of herbicide exposure, the Department of Veterans Affairs (the VA) denied his application for service-connected disability compensation.\n\nAfter taking on his case, a Davis Polk team examined our client’s extensive VA file and discovered a Toxic Exposure Risk Activity (TERA) memo issued years prior by the VA confirming his Agent Orange exposure; our client had not known that this document existed. With this new finding and the previously provided evidence, the Davis Polk team submitted an appeal to the VA in support of our client’s claim that he was deserving of disability compensation. Recognizing its error, the VA proactively issued a new decision, eliminating the need for our client to appear before the CAVC (as is standard procedure). In recognition of his service-connected disability, our client is now receiving compensation – a life changing result.\n\nDue to a wide variety of reasons, including the strain caused by living with or seeking treatment for medical issues, coordinating benefits with the VA and sorting through extensive records can be a challenge for veterans and their families, especially the elderly.\n\nThe Davis Polk team included Chief Pro Bono Counsel Amelia Starr, associates Matthew Cutts, Emily Grabow Yorke, Dan Peck and Nancy Regan and Pro Bono Paralegal Angelica Matoske.",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner and Capital Markets co-head John Meade recently spoke with the American Lawyer about deal activity in the debt markets.\n\nJohn noted that current market conditions have led to differing activity for different areas of the market. Speaking about the investment-grade bond market, John said, “Those markets never really closed. In the last few years, there was a slight pause at the beginning of the pandemic, but then things went on a tear. It continued to be busy in 2020 and 2021, and while 2022 tailed off a bit, I’m not sure if that wasn’t a natural taking of stock,” he said. John added that he has seen a particular uptick in green and sustainable investment-grade debt deals.\n\nTurning to high-yield deals, John explained, “Overall, the high-yield market got slower and slower as 2022 went on. We are still watching it to see what happens. Investor sentiment is much more sensitive to market volatility and macroeconomic factors.”\n\nThe American Lawyer column went on to highlight significant debt issuances from the past week, nearly all of which involved Davis Polk. They included Comcast’s inaugural green bond offering and offerings by Synchrony Financial, Norwegian Cruise Line, Constellation Brands and Integer Holdings.\n\n“Deal Watch: Davis Polk and Others See See Steady Activity in Debt Deals,” American Lawyer (February 13, 2023) (subscription required)",

Jason said that “the firm’s performance reflects both strategic positioning and platform diversification.”\n\n“We’ve built a platform designed to be successful no matter what the markets are doing,” he added. “Even when volumes are low, our broad lender and sponsor relationships and ability to cover the full spectrum of credit products mean we continue to get calls.”\n\nJason also pointed out that what sets Davis Polk apart is its integrated finance platform, spanning syndicated lending, direct lending, investment-grade bridge loans, infrastructure finance, securitization, hybrid and structured products and restructuring, all under one roof.\n\n“This allows the firm to stay relevant across market cycles and pivot quickly when conditions shift,” he said.\n\nDavis Polk is ranked top five in eight of the 12 North America syndicated loan categories. Notably, the firm is ranked first in lender counsel by volume for M&A leveraged loans, buyout leveraged loans, M&A institutional loans and buyout institutional loans. The firm advised on four of the 10 largest deals in the quarter, including Silver Lake Partners’ $7.5 billion Endeavor acquisition financing.\n\n“Simpson Thacher tops borrower rankings as Davis Polk gains market share – Q125 North America Leveraged Loans Legal Advisors Rankings,” Debtwire (April 24, 2025) (subscription required)",

Instead, he added that surgically applying three or four provisions can achieve much of what the omni-blocker aims to accomplish, although its goal of providing more expansive, future protection as LMEs evolve is a credible one.\n\n“This is clearly meant to move beyond fighting the last battle, the last LME to emerge – somebody did a J. Crew LME, so let’s put in place a J. Crew blocker,” Ken explained. “This language wants to deal with the ‘unknown unknown.’”\n\n“Octus: Omni-blockers may soon multiply,” Asset Securitization Reporter (May 23, 2025) (subscription required)",

A 5-4 court decided that third-party releases are categorically unavailable under the bankruptcy code absent new legislation – no matter how salutary, widely supported, or beneficial to help resolve difficult cases. Marshall added that in addition to materially changing chapter 11 practice, this ruling will also spawn substantial follow-on litigation, including with respect to already consummated plans and provisions found in many reorganization plans.\n\nMarshall also discussed circumstances that tend to lead to bankruptcy litigation, tactics creditors are deploying to recover as much value as possible, ways to reach a positive outcome in bankruptcy disputes, structural possibilities and limitations of bankruptcy laws, and how he expects the bankruptcy litigation space to develop over the coming months.\n\nRead the full article",

He explained that a typical day may consist of: meeting with clients to discern the underlying facts, preparing for and conducting key witness interviews and/or depositions, oral argument and other court appearances and hearings, presenting to – or interacting with – government regulators, advising the client, reviewing key documents and evidence, drafting and editing briefs and investigative reports, working with expert witnesses, and prepping for and managing trials. He also teaches and mentors associates and collaborates with counsel and partners.\n\nWhen asked what training, classes, experience or skills development he would recommend to someone who wishes to enter the practice area, Uzo said, “There are many valuable professional experiences and courses that will help prepare law students for a career as a white collar defense attorney. Law students may wish to intern at the DOJ, a U.S. Attorneys’ Office, the SEC, the FTC or other government entities to gain firsthand experience in the regulatory and investigative process. In addition, an internship or clerkship with a federal or state judge can provide a unique opportunity to observe trials, understand the adjudicative process and hone research and writing skills.”\n\nUzo added that law school courses that are particularly useful to white collar defense include Trial Practice, Appellate Practice, Federal and State Courts, Securities Regulation, Criminal Procedure, Evidence, advanced legal writing courses, clinics and other courses related to prosecution.\n\n“Practice Area Insights: White Collar Defense & Internal Investigations,” Vault (March 25, 2024) (subscription required)",

Michael noted, “As interest rates have increased, I’ve seen clients rethink what their financing packages might look like for certain transactions, while some clients suffer higher financing costs or lower proceeds than they initially expected when they began their financing process. For clients that are sellers, I have seen some transactions die because the bids have come in much lower than they were hoping to get a few months ago when they began marketing their asset.”\n\nMichael continued, “There’s more conversations on the strategic side now and transactions take some more thoughtfulness. When deals get a little harder to put together, often clients will have to be more creative with their structures, and that also requires more thought and involvement on the legal side. We get a little more involved and try to structure things a little more creatively, but clients looking for that edge always will come to us and look for that kind of strategic advice.”\n\n“Commercial Real Estate Attorneys Drag Deals Over the Hump in a Bear Market,” Commercial Observer (August 1, 2022)",

FedNow is an instant payment system for banks and credit unions. Financial institutions and their service providers can use the service to provide instant payment services to customers and recipients have full access to funds immediately.\n\n“The idea behind FedNow was that the Fed wanted to make sure that banks of all sizes would have access to real time payments network,” David explained. “There’ll be more discussion around real time payment alternatives to FedNow.”\n\nHe predicts that FedNow will continue to exist alongside private sector alternatives, such as the ClearingHouse Association’s RTP Network and others that use technology such as tokenized payments.\n\nDavid added that another focus in the payment sector in 2024 is the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) review of the role of non-banks in payment services and the rules that govern them. In November 2023, the CFPB proposed new rules to supervise payment service providers such as digital wallets and payment apps. David said the new oversight would allow the CFPB to pursue parity between regulatory requirements for banks and non-banks while banking regulators continue to look into safety and soundness issues in any partnerships between banks and non-banks.\n\nHe noted that there remains an open question about whether the CFPB should use its authority to federally regulate non-bank payment providers.\n\n“What’s in store for 2024: payments,” Lexology (January 16, 2024) (subscription required)",

    "text": "In an interview with Bloomberg Law, Davis Polk Chair and Managing Partner Neil Barr discussed the evolving lateral partner market, how that activity is impacting law firms, how Davis Polk approaches lateral hiring and what the firm expects on that front going forward.\n\nNeil told the publication that he expects to see significant moves across the lateral partner market over the next 18 months as firms continue to modernize and improve at taking and managing risks.\n\n“Consolidation is customarily used to describe a merger, but I think we may look back and conclude this is a time of industry consolidation that’s occurring through lateral activity rather than mergers,” Barr said. “You’re seeing partner movements gravitate toward a handful or two handfuls of firms, and in that respect I think that’s very much going to shape the industry.”\n\nHe explained, “While we have not always prioritized the lateral market, this is a tremendous opportunity for us. So we will be leaning into the market to try and advance our strategic objectives.”\n\nNeil identified areas including London, Northern California and asset management as ripe for expansion. Just last week, Davis Polk announced that prominent leveraged finance practitioner Luke McDougall will join the firm as a partner in London.\n\n“In each of these practices and offices, we very clearly have internal candidates we are going to promote to partner,” Neil said. “None of them will be done exclusively in the lateral market. But in each of these practices or offices we are subscale compared to what we’d like to achieve. So, we will be able to accelerate our strategy by engaging in the lateral market.”\n\nHe added, “As we increasingly look at ourselves as businesses, the thesis for going out into a market of talent and finding talented partners that can augment your firm just becomes self-evident.”\n\nBloomberg Law noted that under Neil’s leadership, the firm has maintained its position as one of the most profitable law firms, even as other firms have been more active in the lateral hiring market. In the piece, Neil also shared that the firm will be making tweaks to its current compensation model for partners in the coming months. But any changes, he said, will stay within the firm’s current framework, which allocates shares to partners based on their total contributions to the firm, does not pay bonuses or guarantees, and has no “credit” system for originating work.\n\n“We want all partners to be aligned on growing the pie for the firm over a long period of time—that is our overarching compensation philosophy,” Neil explained. “It’s a modern compensation philosophy for us that interweaves well with our institutional value system.”\n\n“Davis Polk Leaps Into Lateral Hiring Seen as Re-Shaping Industry,” Bloomberg Law (May 6, 2024) (subscription)",

At the program, Gabe spoke on the “Why Good Regulation (Yes, Regulation) Will Drive the Next Wave of Innovation in Fintech and Banking” panel. The panelists emphasized that most organizations will need clear guardrails to feel comfortable investing in fintech, crypto and digital assets.\n\n“Clarity, clarity, clarity,” said Gabe. “I’ve spoken to so many in the digital asset space who just want to know what they can and can’t do. They don’t want to put in a bunch of investment, time, and money into a project and then be told, ‘You can’t do this’—or even worse, be told regulators are coming after them with enforcement action.”\n\nThe panel also noted that the U.S. is lagging behind other countries in fintech regulation. “What we’re seeing in the U.S. is what people are calling regulation by enforcement—going after various digital asset firms for violating laws that, frankly, firms didn’t know they were violating,” Gabe said. “And that has stifled innovation. Unless it’s done a different way going forward, I think it’s really going to put the U.S. back compared to the rest of the world in these spaces.”\n\n\n\n“Why fintech and crypto companies are craving good regulation,” Fast Company (May 26, 2023)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Robert Cohen was quoted in Cybersecurity Law Report discussing the SEC’s Cyber and Emerging Technologies Unit’s (CETU) seven new priorities. The CETU was created in February 2025 and replaced the Crypto Assets and Cyber Unit.\n\nNoting that the CETU’s 2025 priorities resemble the Cyber Unit’s 2017 priorities from the first Trump administration, Robert said, “The new unit returns to some of the core day-one objectives in 2017 that wound up getting pushed aside by crypto issues in subsequent years.”\n\nHe added that the CETU will focus on classic issues, saying, “Investment scams that use the promise of the latest or trendiest industry to attract retail investors is a perennial SEC enforcement issue.”\n\nAs more companies begin using AI, the article notes that the SEC will likely bring more AI washing cases in coming years. However, Robert noted, “There would need to be strong evidence of fraud and a real intent to deceive about something that was clearly material to investors” for an AI washing case to move forward.\n\nDiscussing the use of examinations to gain feedback about governance, Robert pointed out that the examiners “see companies’ practices across the industry and can see what the norms are for firms, and what practices are outliers.”\n\n“There’s a good chance that the Commission’s leaders will see examinations as a collaborative mechanism to help the industry identify areas where there might be room for improvement or enhancements,” he continued. “Companies should try to have some engagement with the examiners about what the examiners are seeing across the industry. The registrant may have an opportunity to adopt those suggestions without the threat of a big penalty or a public enforcement case.”\n\nCompanies should also “follow the risk alerts that the SEC puts out periodically” to gain AI guidance, Robert recommended.\n\n“Six Steps to Address the SEC’s Trump Era Cyber Enforcement Priorities,” Cybersecurity Law Report (April 9, 2025)",

After experiencing rapid growth since its establishment in 2020, PJP sought Davis Polk’s help in creating a new nonprofit corporation, quickly securing 501(c)(3) tax-exempt status and implementing a corporate governance structure, allowing the organization to raise additional funds to sustain their expanding reach. We have since advised on employment matters and researched a number of subjects related to the prison system, including an analysis of incarcerated authors earning income from sources outside of prison. Davis Polk’s latest work on behalf of PJP has been advising on donor privacy issues and drafting a donor privacy policy.\n\nDavis Polk was first connected to PJP through the Vance Center’s Lawyers for Reporters initiative, which is part of its Public Interest Reporting Program.\n\nLearn more about Davis Polk’s Pro Bono program.",

    "text": "Davis Polk Restructuring co-head Damian Schaible and Restructuring partner and head of Liability Management & Special Opportunities Brian Resnick were quoted in Petition on the biggest restructuring themes and takeaways of 2024 as well as their predictions for 2025.\n\nDiscussing the biggest restructuring theme in 2024, Damian said, “Liability Management 2.0 — Gone are the days of the ‘left behind’ non pro rata deal. Like a troublesome toddler who grows into a precocious and crafty pre-teen, LM has grown up from its litigious and messy roots to become more strategic and organized (but no less problematic). The transactions are almost always driven opportunistically by sponsors and the non pro rata elements (differential economics and exchange ratios) are designed to coerce full participation and avoid litigation.”\n\nDamian added that he predicts post liability management restructurings will be the biggest theme of 2025. “I am working on 6 of them right now in various stages and expect more to come. It turns out when you effectively just add leverage and interest expense it doesn’t always help,” he explained. He added that he thinks that the rate of liability management will increase or remain steady. “Technology and deal dynamics will continue to evolve to permit even greater differential spreads between majority and minority creditors until (hopefully) creditors just get tired of it and coop up broadly and dare the sponsors to light money on fire with the deal away.”\n\nBrian noted that he thinks lower interest rates and less regulatory oversight will lead to increased distressed M&A activity and 363 sales in 2025. He also expects a similar rate of liability management transactions “but with expanding creativity and complexity, and an increasing amount of ‘dips’.”\n\nWhen asked what would be his selection for the most impactful restructuring matter of the year, Brian said, “Purdue for another year. Market is watching to see what comes next for resolving mega mass tort situations.”\n\nDamian’s choice for most impactful restructuring was Pluralsight. “Liability management (lite) enters the private credit market to much fear and trembling in the market.”\n\nAs for the biggest winner of the year, Brian said it would have to be the Delaware bankruptcy bench. “Chapter 11 mega cases are coming back home,” he noted.\n\nOutside of the U.S., Damian said he expects to see distress in Europe next year. “I keep feeling like we are playing piano on the deck of the Titanic over here in the US while the world very unfortunately burns around us (how is that for mixed metaphors?). Ukraine, Israel, energy transition issues, inflation, costs, China, Korea, tariffs to come, it goes on and on and presumably starts to really impact Europe even as it all starts to come for us.”\n\nWhen asked which industry in the U.S. will see the most distress in 2025, Damian said, “Retailers. A lot of them have scraped through but are getting weaker and consumer sentiment and spending will fail to support them as things feel choppier by second half of 2025.”\n\nBrian agreed, adding that “Retail woes continue; potential supply chain disruption and tariffs will lead to some net losers.”\n\n“RX Pros Weigh In.

What if you’re the chain of local auto shops?” said Margaret. “Those guys are relying on the small- and medium-sized banks that are in their community. So it’s the same story that’s over and over and over again: if we hit a recession, then people default on loans.”\n\n“The combination for banks is the combination of interest rates going down — because if we have a recession then interest rates are going to go down — so that’s pressure on net interest margin at the same time that you have increased credit risk,” she added. “So right now everything depends on how long this lasts.”\n\n“Tariffs put banks in a tight spot with Trump,” American Banker (April 7, 2025) (subscription required)",

The firm has been among the top 10 firms by global deal value for the past five years despite having a smaller headcount than the M&A practices at other large firms.\n\n“Given our size, our overall place in the league tables will fluctuate a little bit depending on what our clients are doing,” Oliver explained. “If you look at our competitors who have 100 or more partners, they will do more deals, just by the rule of large numbers.”\n\nWhen asked about the firm’s expansion strategy, Oliver noted that Davis Polk is engaging in the lateral market in a “thoughtful yet aggressive way.” In March, the firm welcomed Michael Diz as a partner in Northern California to strengthen our private equity M&A capabilities.\n\nOliver went on to add that although the first three months of the year were a “great quarter,” it’s hard to predict what will happen in Q2. “In the short term, some of the volatility probably impacts everybody. Long-term, there is a real question as to what cross-border transactions look like,” he said. “That’s the biggest question at some level. And then it’s industry-by-industry and we have to wait and see how things transpire.”\n\n“Davis Polk Is Ready for Private Equity Closeup, Says M&A Boss,” Bloomberg Law (May 8, 2025) (subscription required)",

The plaintiffs sought more than a billion dollars in damages, alleging that the manufacturers “inflated” list prices for insulin with rebates that were used to convince pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to include their products on the formularies that the PBMs create for insurers.\n\nPlaintiffs sought certification under New Jersey law of a nationwide class of consumers. In the alternative, they sought certification of a multi-state class, and of several individual state classes.\n\nIn a 120-page opinion, U.S. District Judge Brian Martinotti of the District of New Jersey rejected all of the proposed classes. The decision is likely to become a landmark opinion in pharmaceutical pricing litigation for years to come.\n\nThe judge found that the plaintiffs couldn’t show an ascertainable loss and that individual questions predominated – including whether individual plaintiffs were insured, the terms of any insurance coverage and whether they benefited from any of the rebates passed down through pharmacy benefit managers or insurers.\n\nThe Davis Polk team representing Novo Nordisk also included counsel Andrew Yaphe, David Toscano and Cristina Rincon and associates Elaine Andersen, Chui-Lai Cheung, Tiffany Chung-Arzeno, Andrei Gribakov Jaffe, Michael Haney, Ian Hogg, Jennifer Kim, Natalie Stoecklein and Keon Zemoudeh.\n\nThe column also recognized Davis Polk for its role representing a defendant in a proposed class action claiming that a group of banks conspired in violation of the antitrust laws to rig auctions in the multi-trillion-dollar market for United States Treasury securities and boycotted trading platforms that offered so-called “all-to-all trading.” The Second Circuit affirmed the district court’s judgment, dismissing the amended complaint with prejudice.\n\n“Litigator of the Week Runners-Up And Shout Outs,” AmLaw Litigation Daily, (February 9, 2024) (subscription required)",

Because it is relatively new, that talent pool is not as large as what it would be for a private equity associate,” she said. “So there has definitely been a talent war in secondaries. Even in the legal profession – where I practice – really smart, talented secondaries lawyers are in very high demand.”\n\nDiscussing Davis Polk’s secondaries practice, she said, “We have a very broad secondaries practice. We have clients that do almost exclusively LP portfolio secondaries, and focus on the buy-side and the sell-side. Then we have a lot of fund sponsor clients … who will do GP-led secondaries transactions and continuation vehicle transactions on the sponsor side. And then we have a very deep roster of buy-side clients, some who are single-asset specialists, some are more flexible and have their own secondaries funds. It’s a very diverse, broad practice.”\n\nOffering advice to young professionals considering a career in secondaries, Sijia said, “Enter that market. It’s actually very welcoming and inviting. Right now it’s still very much a tight-knit community and the culture is great. It’s very welcoming in particular to women, minorities, diverse individuals. I find it to be a very good place for a young lawyer or a young business professional to grow and pick up a lot of very good experience.”\n\n“How Next Gen Leaders see the future of the secondaries market,” Secondaries Investor’s Second Thoughts podcast (November 14, 2024) (subscription)",

In the interview, Dan highlights FinCEN’s priorities for the year and noted that “probably the highest priority for FinCEN is implementing the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA) provisions of the AMLA.”\n\n“In September, FinCEN issued the first of three rules to implement the CTA, the beneficial ownership information (BOI) reporting rule, which imposes requirements on certain legal entities to report beneficial owner and other information to FinCEN for inclusion in a national registry. Then, in December, FinCEN proposed a rule that would govern access to the registry. The third rule, which will conform the beneficial ownership requirements of FinCEN’s existing customer due diligence (CDD) rule to the CTA, is likely to be proposed later this year,” Dan explained.\n\nRegarding when FinCEN might finalize its proposed rule on registry access, Dan added that it is likely that FinCEN will receive a large number of comments, which could mean that the beneficial ownership information registry may not have rules in place by its intended effective date of January 1, 2024.\n\n“U.S. beneficial ownership registry may not be ready by start of 2024, former regulator says,” Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence (February 3, 2023) (subscription required)",

The team was recognized for securing the dismissal of criminal antitrust charges against Jason McGuire in the Department of Justice’s probe of alleged price-fixing in the market for broiler chickens.\n\nThe dismissal followed an October 14 decision by the presiding judge, Hon. Daniel D. Domenico of the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, which effectively rendered much of the government’s evidence inadmissible based on a finding that the government had not sufficiently proved the existence of the charged conspiracy.\n\nAfter conducting a day-long James hearing and considering Davis Polk’s voluminous pre- and post-hearing briefing, Judge Domenico found that the government had not proved the existence of the charged conspiracy. Accordingly, Judge Domenico ruled that none of the 294 emails, texts and statements offered by the government under the hearsay exception for co-conspirator statements was admissible at trial. The government’s motion to dismiss the case acknowledged this ruling as its catalyst.\n\nA complete victory after a James hearing is nearly unprecedented.\n\n“Another Jam-Packed Edition of Litigator of the Week Runners-Up and Shout Outs,” Litigation Daily (October 21, 2022) (subscription required)\n\nRead more about the case in the Wall Street Journal (“Price-Fixing Charges Against Chicken-Industry Executives Are Dismissed,” October 17, 2022) and Law360 (“DOJ Drops Last Chicken Price-Fixing Case,” October 17, 2022).",

He will focus on representing clients in criminal and regulatory investigations, as well as in civil and criminal trials.\n\n“Dan joins a phenomenal group of Davis Polk lawyers in Washington, and his substantial experience and impressive track record at DOJ, in the United States and abroad, will be a significant asset to our preeminent white collar team,” said Neil Barr, Davis Polk’s Managing Partner. “We are excited to welcome Dan back to Davis Polk.”\n\nMr. Kahn will join Davis Polk from the Department of Justice, where he served in a number of senior positions, including most recently as acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division, supervising the Fraud Section and Appellate Section. Prior to that, he served as acting Chief of the Fraud Section and Chief of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) Unit. As acting Chief of the Fraud Section, Mr. Kahn supervised approximately 180 prosecutors and managed the day-to-day operations of the Fraud Section. He directly oversaw the FCPA Unit, Market Integrity and Major Frauds Unit, Health Care Fraud Unit, and Strategy, Policy and Training Unit, including all investigations, prosecutions, corporate resolutions and compliance monitorships. These cases involved FCPA and sanctions violations, commodities and securities fraud, healthcare fraud, digital currency, fintech, consumer fraud, procurement fraud, financial institutions fraud, and money laundering.\n\nAs Chief of the FCPA Unit from 2016 to 2019, Mr. Kahn managed all FCPA and FCPA-related investigations, prosecutions and resolutions in the Department of Justice, which included cases involving every major industry sector and geographic region. He led the substantial expansion of coordination and cooperation with foreign authorities in international corruption probes, working with authorities from countries around the globe, overseeing more than a dozen coordinated resolutions and routinely representing the United States before global anti-corruption bodies. These complex multinational investigations often involved coordination with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Reserve Board and multilateral development banks, among other regulators. Mr. Kahn also supervised and oversaw the selection of approximately 20 FCPA monitors during his tenure as Unit Chief, and oversaw the revisions and updates to A Resource Guide to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\n“Dan is an incredibly talented lawyer. He is highly respected in the white collar space, and he has built a second-to-none reputation in his many years of distinguished government service,” said Angela Burgess, co-head of Davis Polk’s White Collar Defense & Investigations practice. “We are thrilled to welcome him back to the firm.”\n\nDan Kahn said, “My time at DOJ was an extremely rewarding chapter of my career. I had the privilege of working on significant white collar enforcement and policy matters with some of the most talented and dedicated professionals, both within DOJ and at U.S. regulatory and foreign enforcement authorities. As I transition back to private practice, I am very excited to return to Davis Polk, where I began my legal career. I look forward to working with the firm’s exceptional white collar team and using my experience to help clients navigate their most sensitive issues.”\n\nMr. Kahn joined the Fraud Section as a trial lawyer in 2010, and became an Assistant Chief in the FCPA Unit in 2013 before becoming the Chief of that Unit in 2016. He was promoted to Senior Deputy Chief of the Fraud Section in 2019, and to acting Chief of the Fraud Section in 2020. In his 11 years in the Fraud Section, Mr. Kahn supervised dozens of trials, including FCPA, securities fraud, wire fraud and money laundering trials. He also oversaw more than 40 corporate resolutions and was the lead prosecutor in 10 corporate resolutions. Mr. Kahn twice earned the Assistant Attorney General’s Award for Exceptional Service, as well as the Assistant Attorney General’s Award for Distinguished Service, and was selected as DOJ’s liaison to the ABA Standards Committee on Monitors.\n\nPrior to joining DOJ, Mr. Kahn spent more than six years as an associate at Davis Polk, where he worked on a number of complex corporate matters and represented companies facing allegations and investigations relating to securities fraud, accounting fraud and antitrust violations. In addition, in a pro bono matter, Mr. Kahn helped secure the retrial and acquittal of a defendant wrongfully convicted of murder, and then successfully first-chaired a trial against the State of New York under New York’s wrongful conviction statute. Mr. Kahn also served for 10 years on the board of directors of the Congressional Hunger Center.\n\nMr. Kahn received his J.D., cum laude, from Harvard Law School and B.S., summa cum laude, from Cornell University. He is a Lecturer on Law at Harvard Law School and an Adjunct Professor at Georgetown Law.",

    "text": "A Davis Polk team received first runner-up honors in AmLaw Litigation Daily’s “Litigator of the Week” column for securing a victory for Morgan Stanley in a longstanding residential mortgage-backed securities case.\n\nSince 2012, Davis Polk has defended Morgan Stanley in the Commercial Division of New York Supreme Court, New York County, against common law fraud claims brought by German bank IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG (“IKB”) arising from the sale of residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) between 2005 and 2007.  Throughout the case, Davis Polk steadily narrowed IKB’s claims—including by obtaining dismissals of several claims at the pleading stage, defeating IKB’s subsequent motion to add a mutual mistake claim and successfully defending that victory on appeal.\n\nIn 2023, Davis Polk obtained partial summary judgment for Morgan Stanley on the core of IKB’s case: its claim that Morgan Stanley allegedly misrepresented that the mortgage loans backing its RMBS complied with the loan underwriting guidelines of the originators who made those loans. Based on the undisputed evidence, the court concluded that Morgan Stanley had not made any representations about underwriting guideline compliance in the preliminary term sheets for the securitizations – the only documents that IKB’s investment managers received or relied upon in making purchase decisions. The court, however, permitted IKB to proceed to trial on the other two purported misrepresentations alleged in the complaint concerning the loan-to-value ratios and owner occupancy status of the underlying loans. The court adjourned trial until October 2024 while the parties cross-appealed to the Appellate Division, First Department, of the New York Supreme Court, which affirmed the summary judgment order in full in March 2024.\n\nFollowing the Appellate Division’s ruling, the parties proceeded to prepare for trial. But, when IKB refused to withdraw proposed evidence and expert testimony concerning its now-dismissed underwriting guidelines claim, Morgan Stanley filed motions in limine to exclude that and other related evidence.\n\nFollowing oral argument on August 6, 2024, the court granted Morgan Stanley’s in limine motions in whole or substantial part, reaffirming that the trial would “be about LTV, [owner occupancy] and only as to the loans underlying the securities in this case.” The court struck the testimony of one of IKB’s experts in its entirety and significantly limited the testimony of two other IKB experts. In the following weeks, IKB acknowledged to the Court that its “case is no longer triable” and that few if any of its trial exhibits relate to LTV, owner occupancy or the loans backing the RMBS at issue. Nevertheless, IKB continued to refuse to revise its trial exhibits and witness list to conform to the in limine rulings.\n\nOn August 26, 2024, Davis Polk sought an order directing IKB to revise its trial exhibits, witness list and deposition designations, and the court scheduled a hearing for the following day. At the hearing on August 27, IKB made the stunning admission that it could not prove scienter and stated that it would ask the court to dismiss its complaint and enter final judgment, subject to its right to appeal. This is an important victory in the last of Morgan Stanley’s financial crisis era cases.\n\nThe Davis Polk team representing Morgan Stanley was led by partners James Rouhandeh, Greg Andres and Dana Seshens, and also included counsel Daniel J. Schwartz and associates Matthew R. Brock, Tess Liegeois, Michael V. Pucci, Muhammad Sardar, Jaclyn Willner, Cristina Lauren Lang, John Chapman III, Zach Zaremba and Tony Sun.\n\n“Litigator of the Week Runners-Up and Shout-Outs,” AmLaw Litigation Daily (August 30, 2024) (subscription required)",

Currently, only part of the CTA has been implemented.\n\nDan noted that the third and final CTA implementation step will have the greatest impact on banks. When it is proposed, it will comprise amendments aiming to conform the existing customer due diligence (CDD) rule to new beneficial ownership requirements. This will be a challenging task given that the CTA directs FinCEN to rescind and replace most of the existing CDD rule’s beneficial ownership requirements.\n\n“We’re probably in the third of nine innings for CTA, although the contours of where FinCEN is heading are becoming clearer,” Dan explained. He added that the CDD rule took six years from the start of deliberations to its effective date, and completion of the CTA’s amendments may be another three to five years away.\n\n“FinCEN’s slow and confusing start to AMLA raises bankers’ concerns,” ABA Banking Journal (October 19, 2023)",

Monica had been serving 23 years of a 50-year-to-life sentence for second-degree murder and other crimes. A victim of severe domestic abuse, Monica had been forced by her then-husband to participate in the crimes.\n\nWithout this grant of clemency, Monica would not have even been eligible for parole for another 22 years. Her clemency grant was one of only two sentence commutations given to incarcerated individuals in New York State at this time.\n\nMonica was a victim of severe domestic violence, whose then-husband kidnapped her at gunpoint and, through continued physical abuse and armed threats, kept her hostage and forced her to accompany him as he committed several assaults and kidnappings, resulting in one death. Monica used her 23 years at Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women to transform herself through education and positive relationships into a strong survivor – a true testament to her deep remorse for her participation in the crimes. She has served as a supporter of other women and is an extraordinary example of the power of positive change and the resilience of the human spirit.\n\nThe Davis Polk team, led by Pro Bono Attorney Dara Sheinfeld, prepared an extensive and compelling clemency application and galvanized support from leaders of prominent domestic violence, survivors and women’s justice organizations throughout New York State. Monica was referred to Davis Polk through the Initiative for Incarcerated Survivors of Gender Based Violence, a group founded by Sanctuary for Families that meets regularly at Davis Polk’s New York office.

Dan noted that non-bank institutions probably lag behind banks in formally assessing their vulnerabilities to financial crime, and a new risk assessment mandate would boost regulators’ enforcement powers for all categories of financial institution. He added that FinCEN’s plan will change risk assessments from a supervisory expectation into a legal requirement that can be directly addressed through enforcement.\n\n“FinCEN Sets Timetable for Mandatory Risk Assessments, ‘Effective’ AML Programs,” MoneyLaundering.com, (January 28, 2022) (subscription required)",

In the Q&A, David highlights the overwhelming increase in intellectual property cases filed in U.S. courts in the last twenty years and explains that the biggest disagreements in patent or trademark disputes often center on the validity of the right at issue, whether it is being used and, if so, the value of such use, all of which are typically heavily disputed.\n\nDavid also notes that if a company suspects its rights have been infringed, or if it is accused of infringing another party’s rights, developing a decisive strategy early is crucial. A company that suspects its rights have been infringed must consider the potential risks and benefits of asserting the rights. The company accused of infringement must carefully consider its response to any notice of alleged infringement, including whether and how to deny infringement, change its practices, to file challenges at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or file countersuits.\n\nWhen asked what essential advice he would offer to companies on effectively protecting, monitoring and enforcing their patent and trademark rights, David recommended that companies conduct an assessment of their most valuable assets and then invest the time and resources to ensure those assets are properly documented, registered and protected.\n\n“Patent and trademark disputes,” Corporate Disputes (Apr - Jun 2024 issue)",

Specifically, the Court reasoned that defendants “had no duty to disclose the possibility that Uniti’s status as a REIT and the Master Lease could be threatened by potential legal action, particularly when, at the time they made the alleged representations, they had no indication that any lawsuit was forthcoming.” The Court further found that, even if there were such a duty, the company’s disclosures adequately disclosed the risk.\n\n“Litigator of the Week Runners-Up and Shout Outs,” Litigation Daily (August 19, 2022) (subscription required)",

He also noted that it is not clear what a bank should do if it discovers the information it is collecting from a customer does not match what is in the registry.\n\n“What I hope doesn’t happen is that banks become the de-facto quality control function for the registry, where they’re obligated to point out discrepancies or inaccuracies,” Dan said.\n\n“For US Beneficial Ownership Database, Deepest Pitfalls May Lie Ahead,” MoneyLaundering.com (October 24, 2022) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner and Asia practice chair Martin Rogers discussed tech-based crime in Asia’s emerging digital markets and the need for robust anti-money laundering (AML) regulations with Asian Legal Business.\n\nWhen asked about cryptocurrency-related financial crime, Martin said, “The way forward domestically for the crypto industry should be to embrace regulation and licensing and then impose balanced AML requirements. Hong Kong is a good model for this, with its Virtual Asset Service Provider regulatory framework including KYC [know your customer]/AML requirements as a core element. It’s worth emphasizing, though, that the AML requirements need to be tailored to account for the nature of the global cryptocurrency markets.”\n\n“Domestic laws should cover not just AML and CTF [counter-terrorism financing] but also cybersecurity. This is an area where Hong Kong is still in the process of catching up, currently lacking sufficient cybercrime offences (and as yet any legislation to protect critical information infrastructure, although this is in the works),” Martin added.\n\nThe article also notes that the attitude towards corruption is a key element of financial crime in Asian markets.\n\n“Corruption is often at the heart of financial crime. In the majority of cases involving financial crime, corruption plays a crucial, if sometimes small, part. Corruption is still a major issue in Asia, with low-level corruption in particular still not really seen as criminal in nature,” Martin explained. “Domestic anti-corruption laws should be strongly enforced with appropriate investment in strong anti-corruption agencies, with more whistleblowing.”\n\nMartin also highlighted that “fast-accelerating technological developments in areas such as cyberhacking, AI and data manipulation present potentially an overwhelming challenge.”\n\n“White-collar crime: The money war,” Asian Legal Business (June 26, 2024)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner and Restructuring practice co-head Damian Schaible discussed the surge in liability management exercises (LME) as well as the restructuring outlook for this year with Debtwire.\n\nThe article notes that LME activity is expected to remain elevated throughout the year as persistently high interest rates, political risk and maturity walls push borrowers to consider restructuring options with creditors and third-party capital providers that allow existing equity investors to preserve their ownership.\n\n“We’ve started to see full restructurings of post-LME companies that hit subsequent road bumps or don’t realize sufficient deleveraging,” Damian explained. “In some of these situations, we are seeing creditors and equity holders come together to effectuate out-of-court changes of control.”\n\nWhen asked about what is fueling LME activity, Damian said, “There is a very large and active private credit and special situations market that is extremely interested in doing [LME and new money] deals, such as funding into a drop-down vehicle.” He added that private credit funds are increasingly competing with existing lenders of a company to provide capital. Capital from these special situations funds are no longer more expensive than the money coming from the creditors in some situations.\n\nAdditionally, the article highlighted that cooperation agreements, which were a major driver in restructuring in 2024, are also expected to shift this year.\n\n“I think cooperation agreements will continue to evolve in 2025,” Damian said, adding that while 100% participation co-ops were once the norm, there are more 50% co-ops in the market now that are intended to secure and preserve a majority group.\n\n“You’re going to continue to see some co-ops that permit non pro-rata treatment among steer co-members and broader ad hoc group members and some co-ops that contemplate variable treatment between initial participants and later-added participants,” Damian noted, adding that the lengths of co-ops are also changing, with co-ops until maturity and even into bankruptcies being preferred by lenders in some situations.\n\n“Creditors set to take control even as LME spree shows no signs of ending – US Restructuring Outlook,” Debtwire (January 31, 2025)",

The allegations donʼt address a garden variety PE roll-up and the case is based on traditional antitrust concerns rather than new theories of harm.”\n\n“Dealspeak North America – Sponsors beware: Roll-up and add-on strategies are on regulatorsʼ radars,” Mergermarket (December 18, 2023) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Brian Burnovski, counsel Matthew Cormack and associates Chui-Lai Cheung and Jessica Simonelli received a shout-out in AmLaw Litigation Daily’s “Litigator of the Week” column for securing a complete victory for Nuvei in connection with litigation arising out of its acquisition of Paya Holdings, Inc. The decision marks one of the very few cases interpreting the All-Holders Rule and Best Price Rule, promulgated under section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and will provide useful guidance in these types of matters going forward.\n\nPlaintiffs were holders of earnout shares in Paya, which had gone public through a de-SPAC transaction with Fintech Acquisition Corp. III. As part of the de-SPAC transaction, the plaintiffs had entered into a sponsor support agreement, pursuant to which certain of their shares in the SPAC were converted to earnout shares in Paya. Under the terms of the sponsor support agreement, in the event of any future change of control where the price per share paid did not meet a specified threshold, the earnout shares would be automatically forfeited “immediately prior to” the change of control.\n\nIn January 2023, Nuvei entered into a merger agreement to acquire Paya for $9.75 per share. The transaction was structured as a two-step merger under section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law (DGCL), which permits a corporation to effectuate a merger without requiring a separate shareholder vote to authorize the merger where the corporation first consummates a tender offer for all of the outstanding stock of the target corporation. The plaintiffs sought to tender their earnout shares in the first-step tender offer but the shares were not accepted because, among other things, the $9.75 merger price did not meet the threshold required to avoid forfeiture under the terms of the sponsor support agreement in any change of control.\n\nAfter their earnout shares were not accepted in the offer, the plaintiffs filed suit in Delaware federal court, asserting claims for violations of the All-Holder Rule and the Best Price Rule of the 1934 Act and of section 251(h) of the DGCL, and breach of the merger agreement. Davis Polk filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on November 15, 2023, arguing, among other things, that pursuant to the terms of the sponsor support agreement, the plaintiffs’ earnout shares were subject to transfer restrictions that made them ineligible for tender and, additionally, had been forfeited “immediately prior to” Nuvei’s acceptance of any shares for payment in the offer, whereby Nuvei gained control of Paya in a change of control transaction.\n\nOn October 17, 2024, Judge Gregory B. Williams of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware granted the motion to dismiss the complaint in the entirety, and denied as moot the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment.\n\n“Another Stellar Crop of Litigator of the Week Runners-Up and Shout-Outs,” AmLaw Litigation Daily (October 25, 2024) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Michael Hong was featured in a video by Investor Relations Network discussing his role as a fund formation lawyer.\n\nWhen asked about the current relationship between LPs and GPs, Michael said, “It’s a buyers’ market really fueled by the fact that capital is scarce, and exits have been equally scarce.”\n\n“It means that everything is kind of up for grabs from a terms perspective,” he continued. “I think provisions that may have been viewed as well settled in GP agreements or in side letters are on the table in a way that I haven’t seen … since the great financial crisis.”\n\nSpeaking about how he fits into the investor relations role, Michael noted, “I did better at fund formation when I view myself and modeled myself as an extension of the investor relations function. I think there was a time when if you were outside counsel, like me, the primary point of contact would be the general counsel or the general counsel equivalent. And that still is true to a certain extent, but in fact the constituency that I find myself interacting with a lot – and frankly have to keep happy in order to get the next assignment – is the client.”\n\nHe added, “I am fundamentally interacting and negotiating with my client’s client. So, if I don’t adopt the imperatives of the IR [investor relations] function and understand what is important to them and not important to the firm and the institution, I may not get the next assignment. I think that’s a bit of an evolution in what fund formation lawyers do today than it may have been done 10 years ago.”\n\nMichael emphasized that it is important for a fund formation lawyer to take a step back and talk to the firm holistically. “And depending on that [conversation], you have to calibrate, not just your interactions with the investors and their counsel, but also calibrate your advice. There might be things on the table that you need to lean on your client: ‘You might need to be prepared to give up this term or that term.’”\n\nDiscussing the unique relationship between placement agents and outside counsel, he said, “Far too many agents and law firms alike view themselves are disparate service providers with different incentives and different motivations. I have really enjoyed developing relationships with placements agents because we have the same goal, and there are actually amazing opportunities to work behind the scenes together … to fundamentally deliver a cohesive product to the client.”\n\n",

The award honors the lawyers who led 2022’s most complex deals – those who relied on ingenuity, deep client relationships and novel arrangements to get their clients’ deals done.\n\nLeonard and Will were recognized for their work advising Brookfield Business Partners in connection with the $16 billion acquisition of Nielsen by a private equity consortium led by Brookfield and Evergreen Coast Capital Corporation. The deal – the second-largest LBO of 2022 – faced many obstacles and complications.\n\nFor one, Nielsen was U.S.-listed, therefore falling outside the scope of the U.K. takeover code, but it was UK-incorporated, meaning the deal was subject to UK court approval pursuant to a scheme of arrangement. “Schemes of arrangement of U.K. companies listed in the U.S. always raise some interesting corporate law issues as a result of the way U.K. shares are held and traded in the U.S.,” Will told the American Lawyer.\n\nHe went on to explain that the multijurisdictional nature of the deal “afforded advisers a little more creativity to use tools from both markets.”\n\nThe American Lawyer’s 2023 “Dealmakers of the Year” were announced on March 27, 2023, and featured in the April 2023 print edition of the publication’s magazine.\n\nRead the profile",

In addition to earn out disputes, we are also seeing an increased number of disputes arise over other provisions, such as indemnities, which usually get worked out but are taking longer to resolve as parties hang on to small dollar value differences rather than settling for a middle ground.”\n\n“Arbitrating M&A disputes,” Corporate Disputes (Jan-Mar 2024 issue)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner David Portilla was quoted in American Banker discussing how the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s (FSOC) approach to systemic risk posed by nonbanks may change under the incoming administration. David thinks that the Trump administration will favor nonbanks when compared with prior administrations.\n\n“Under the Trump administration, I think you’ll likely see less scrutiny of the nonbank sector,” he said. “Perhaps even more support for the nonbank sector and private capital, representing a shift from the current administration’s intense scrutiny of this area.”\n\nThe article noted that FSOC has the power to designate nonbank financial institutions as “systemically important financial institutions” (SIFIs) if it determines that their failure could destabilize the U.S. economy. David pointed out that one of the consequences of designation is that it incentivizes companies to change their structure to escape the heightened scrutiny.\n\n“The prior process demonstrated that designation is indeed a severe tool, and once designated, companies tend to be dynamic, often taking actions to be de-designated,” David said. “At the same time, the current administration has been clear that entity-level designation is not necessarily the preferred tool, but one they believe should be available.”\n\nHe also noted that the first Trump administration saw FSOC as opaque and arbitrarily punitive toward nonbanks. David said, “I think the designation process has been criticized for lacking transparency and for creating competitive distortions on an uneven playing field. The Trump administration was responsive to those critiques and revised it for that reason.”\n\nDiscussing what to expect from FSOC over the next few years, David said, “FSOC is politically responsive, perhaps more so than some other financial regulators. We’ll have to wait and see who the Treasury secretary and the Federal Reserve chair will be over the course of the administration … but I think, inevitably, FSOC’s direction will reflect the priorities of President Trump.”\n\n“There’s a high bar for designation under the current administration,” he continued. “And likely an even higher bar under a Republican administration, barring some crisis.”\n\n“FSOC approach to nonbanks unlikely to change under Trump,” American Banker (November 14, 2024) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk today announced that the firm is launching a European antitrust practice in Brussels. The practice will be led by Jürgen Schindler and Frances Dethmers.\n\n“The European Commission is a critical antitrust authority. We are excited to be able to offer our clients sophisticated antitrust capabilities with respect to matters under EU law,” said Neil Barr, Davis Polk’s Managing Partner. “We are thrilled to welcome Jürgen and Frances to Davis Polk.”\n\nThe firm’s office in Brussels will open in 2023.\n\nMr. Schindler and Ms. Dethmers join the firm from Allen & Overy, where both served as partners and Mr. Schindler as co-head of the global competition and antitrust group. Mr. Schindler has extensive experience advising clients on complex international, EU and German merger control, cartel and abuse of dominance cases. His practice encompasses a broad range of sectors, including energy, finance, technology, transport (shipping and airlines), raw materials, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and consumer and industrial products. In addition, Mr. Schindler litigates before the European courts in Luxembourg.\n\nMr. Schindler’s practice has extensive geographic coverage; he has advised clients in Europe, the United States, Latin America, Asia and the Middle East. He is admitted to practice in Germany, Belgium and New York. He will join Davis Polk as a partner.\n\nHe is a Non-Governmental Adviser to the European Commission and to the German Competition Authority at the International Competition Network (ICN), which includes around 140 competition authorities worldwide, and he regularly contributes to the ICN’s cartel and merger working groups. In addition, he is a long-time editorial board member of the ABA’s Antitrust Magazine Online.\n\nMs. Dethmers’ practice focuses on international, EU and Dutch competition law. She is an economist and a qualified lawyer. She has extensive experience advising clients from a wide range of industries (in particular, pharmaceuticals, health and life sciences, consumer and industrial products, chemicals and packaging) on highly complex merger control procedures, as well as on cartel investigations, abuse of dominance investigations, intellectual property issues and licensing and distribution agreements. Prior to working in private practice, she worked at the Dutch Competition Authority and the European Commission. Her background as an economist gives her unique insight into the economic concepts and analytical tools at the heart of competition law. She is admitted to practice in the Netherlands. She will join Davis Polk as Special Adviser – EU Antitrust.\n\n“Jürgen and Frances are exceptional lawyers with an outstanding reputation in Brussels, and we are thrilled to have them on board to help us launch our EU antitrust practice,” said Art Burke, head of Davis Polk’s Antitrust & Competition practice. “Their significant experience across merger control matters, cartels and antitrust litigation will benefit our clients greatly and will further solidify our position as a leading global antitrust firm.”\n\nDavis Polk is recognized as a preeminent firm in antitrust and competition law, including with top-tier rankings from publications such as Global Competition Review, Benchmark Litigation and Chambers USA. Clients rely on Davis Polk’s deep experience across the full spectrum of antitrust and competition matters. The firm steers clients through sensitive antitrust investigations and high-stakes litigation, including class actions and government enforcement actions. Davis Polk also serves in a lead role for large defense groups, including in cases alleging cartel behavior in numerous industries and financial markets. Having addressed and resolved antitrust issues presented by thousands of transactions across all economic sectors, the firm is widely recognized in particular for its work on cross-border combinations and routinely acts as coordinating counsel for international merger control review for complex transactions.\n\nMr. Schindler said, “Frances and I are very excited to be joining Davis Polk, a firm we have long held in high esteem. We have been struck by the strong culture that permeates throughout the firm, and we very much look forward to working with this fantastic team and helping the firm to execute on this strategic expansion of its global antitrust capabilities. We are very grateful for our time as partners at Allen & Overy.”\n\nRanked as a leading EU competition lawyer by Chambers Europe, Mr. Schindler in 1999 graduated from the University of Hamburg and earned an LLM in European Law from the College of Europe in Bruges. In 2007, he earned an LLM from Georgetown University Law Center focusing on U.S. antitrust law and economics. Ms. Dethmers earned a master’s degree in economics in 1998 and a master’s degree in law in 2001, both from the University of Amsterdam.",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Joe Hall discussed crypto “dust” and its prevalence in bitcoin exchange traded funds with the Financial Times. Dust refers to digital assets that are embedded in cryptocurrency transactions as byproducts.\n\nSeveral exchange traded funds that invest in bitcoin have received “dust” in the form of non-bitcoin tokens that they did not buy and are unable to sell. Bitcoin ETF managers would need regulatory approval to sell the bonus virtual assets in order to comply with tax regulations.\n\n“These are just weird crypto artifacts that legacy SEC structures and legacy tax structures were not designed to accommodate,” Joe explained.\n\nIf bitcoin ETFs were to sell the assets without approval, it could imperil their legal status and “kill the product,” Joe noted.\n\n“Vomiting frogs and other ‘dust’ prove vexing for US bitcoin ETFs,” Financial Times (April 29, 2024) (subscription required)",

It’s often those relationships developed ‘in the trenches’ that are the most meaningful as you become a more senior practitioner.” She continued, “Find small ways to stay in touch with people you enjoy working with – whether it be forwarding interesting articles or a quick email if you see someone closed an interesting transaction – the small things add up over time, and you never know who may be a client down the road.”\n\nDiscussing the role mentorship has played in her career, Hilary commented, “It’s worth noting that some of my biggest mentors and sponsors have styles, personalities and backgrounds very different from my own. I often tell younger lawyers that your best teachers and backers might come from unexpected sources in your career, so keep an open mind and be willing to engage with those who are willing to invest in you.”\n\nHilary said that the part of her job that she enjoys the most is “the relationships I’ve developed over the years, whether with my colleagues, my clients or other professionals, [they] are what bring the most joy to my practice. On the technical side, I enjoy getting to know my clients’ businesses and the plans for any investment. When you really understand what a given business needs and the industry that it is operating in, you can use practical examples to bridge the gap in negotiations. It’s incredibly satisfying to know that we planned for a certain transaction when crafting a covenant package and then were able to execute on the strategy seamlessly under the documents.”\n\n“Recognizing Excellence: Hilary Dengel,” The Secured Lender (March 12, 2024)",

Among these individuals is our client Billie Allen, who was arrested at the age of 19 for a crime he maintains he did not commit – a bank robbery in which a security guard tragically lost his life.\n\nIn the 27 years since his arrest, Mr. Allen has used his time in prison productively by writing and illustrating children’s books, creating poignant art that has been exhibited across the country and designing a clothing line.\n\nDavis Polk joined Mr. Allen’s case in October 2024 after his team of counsel, including Shook Hardy & Bacon, submitted a clemency application on his behalf and presented to the Office of the Pardon Attorney. Over the past few months, a Davis Polk team of partners, counsel and associates in New York, Northern California and Washington DC have assisted with strategic advocacy and the submission of a supplemental letter in further support of Mr. Allen’s petition for clemency.\n\nThe Davis Polk team includes partners Greg Andres, Paul Nathanson and Brian Weinstein, Counsel and Head of Racial Justice Pro Bono Diane Lucas, Counsel and Head of Pro Bono Litigation Dara Sheinfeld, associates Stephanie Hansen, Chitra Kulkarni, Onuoha Odim and Matthew Stratis Vasilakos and paralegal Patrick Chappel.",

They make doing deals easy,” Ken explained. “They want to seem like the user-friendly option so that other companies will be willing to do the next deal with them.”\n\nWhen asked about the competitive landscape for legal work in Japan and how that impacts international firms, Ken said, “The leading private equity firms know that the best Japanese legal talent is at the Japanese law firms and so you see them using the top Japanese firms on the most significant deals in the market. They just want the best talent so I think that plays to our strengths as we don’t compete with the local firms, we work with the leading Japanese firms and those are the deals that we traditionally work on.”\n\n“Japan’s PE Market Is the Bright Spot That Asia Needs.

They will co-lead the firm’s London restructuring practice.\n\n“We are thrilled to welcome Jifree and Mark to Davis Polk and officially launch our restructuring practice in London,” said Damian Schaible, co-head of Davis Polk’s Restructuring practice. “Jifree and Mark are very well known and well respected in the market. They have deep relationships with and are trusted by a wide range of sophisticated investors in Europe, many of whom are already clients of our firm, from their excellent work advising both companies and creditors in restructurings across the globe.”\n\nThe duo will be joined by several new counsel and associates and will continue to build out the European restructuring team over the coming months.\n\nJifree Cader said, “Davis Polk has one of the world’s preeminent restructuring practices. I am excited to join such an elite firm with a clear strategy to grow its London platform and expand the reach of its global restructuring capabilities. I look forward to working with the teams in the U.S. and London to capitalize on the growing market for restructuring transactions in Europe.”\n\nMark Knight said, “The team at Davis Polk is not only elite, but creative and energetic. The opportunity to be a part of that, and to help build the firm’s London restructuring practice, while continuing to work alongside Jifree, is truly exciting. I look forward to collaborating with my new colleagues as we tackle complex restructuring matters for our clients.”\n\nMr. Cader advises clients on all facets of restructuring and insolvency and has deep experience working on matters across the UK, Europe, MENA, Latin America and Asia.\n\nHe works with private equity firms, hedge funds, investment banks and other distressed debt and par investors, providing advice on their investment portfolios. He also regularly advises debtors and has been lead debtor counsel on a number of market-leading cases. He is widely recognized as a leading restructuring practitioner, including in the Legal 500 UK and Chambers UK, where a client noted that he is “a superstar” who “has been highly impactful on very complex transactions.”\n\nMr. Knight is a seasoned restructuring and special situations lawyer who has successfully led many complex restructurings and refinancings, acting for creditors, debtors, sponsors and enforcing agents. He works closely with key stakeholders around the capital structure. His practice is focused on all stages of the restructuring life cycle, including investment structuring, contingency planning and strategy, negotiations, implementation, post-restructuring optimization of existing investments, and exit. Mr. Knight is ranked by multiple industry publications, including Chambers UK, where clients have described him as “outstanding” and “a highly commercial-and client-focused lawyer.",

But it can’t hurt. “The uptick [in debt issuances] clearly demonstrates how strong and resilient the investment-grade debt markets are,” he said. “The high-yield bond market also appears to be showing improved signs of life after a pretty anemic 2023 on the whole.”\n\n“With history as a guide, it seems unlikely to continue at this pace,” he continued. “If anything, the second half could be quieter than normal, if a lot of upcoming maturities that need refinancing have been dealt with in the first half.”\n\nDiscussing the current rates, John said, “If economic sentiment and confidence improves, then maybe we could expect more M&A with resulting event-driven financings.”\n\nHe continued, noting, “There is not necessarily any great correlation between a healthy investment-grade debt market and a return to a booming IPO market.”\n\nThe article also noted that Davis Polk was involved in the most debt offerings in the last week.\n\n“Deal Watch: Davis Polk, Latham and Simpson Land on Rising Debt Deal Work,” American Lawyer (March 4, 2024) (subscription required)",

Morgan Asset Management had appeared to make an early bid to proceed without an accredited investor requirement. “The J.P. Morgan Credit Markets Fund, in its initial Form N-2 filing in February, listed no mention of an accredited investor limitation in a section where managers would normally cite it,” he said.\n\n“The J.P. Morgan filing was the first to really push the envelope further,” he added.\n\nAt an SEC forum in May 2025, Chairman Paul Atkins and Director of the SEC’s Division of Investment Management Natasha Greiner mentioned reviewing and potentially stepping back from the staff position.\n\n“In the weeks since Atkins and Greiner spoke, other managers have discussed making their own moves,” Greg said. “We represent a number of registered funds of funds that are currently subject to the limitation that are actively interested in [exploring how] they could use this to expand their investor base.”\n\n“These events should not be a surprise to the market, as the SEC has been telegraphing its intentions,” said Chris. “Anybody who had been paying attention was aware that those conversations had been happening.”\n\n“SEC Lifts Accredited Investor Limit on Two Cliffwater Interval Funds,” FundFire (June 3, 2025) (subscription required)",

In a nutshell, the unsecured noteholder group bids an amount of cash that it would otherwise receive as proceeds from the asset sale or under a chapter 11 plan. This only works, of course, if the unsecured noteholders are far enough in the money, but in those circumstances, it is an important tool to maximize value in the sale process,” Darren explained.\n\nWhen asked how he would characterize the current appetite of distressed investors, Darren said, “Distressed investors continue to express an interest in distressed assets where they believe the return on investment is there.”\n\nDarren also went on to describe the particular challenges the distressed M&A process generally involves, what strategies and methodologies should be employed to value distressed companies and how parties should manage the competing interests of the various groups associated with a distressed transaction.\n\n“Roundtable: Distressed M&A,” Financier Worldwide (December 2023 issue)",

    "text": "The Brooklyn Debate League, which provides accessible speech and debate programs to students in New York City public schools, last year experienced a sudden new gust of wind under its wings – a viral feature on the popular social media accounts of “Humans of New York.”\n\nThe post highlighted Jonathan Conyers, a New Yorker from a troubled upbringing, who credits his high school debate coach with helping him turn his life around. He shared that his coach, known as “DiCo,” went on to found the rapidly growing League with the goal of helping even more students like him, but the organization was struggling financially and due to run out of funds in the near future. The post revealed that DiCo had even contributed large sums from his own savings to ensure that students would not be turned away from debate activities because of inability to pay. Seemingly overnight, a GoFundMe fundraising page linked to the post garnered more than $1.3 million in donations to the League and national media attention.\n\nAfter seeing the story, Davis Polk Restructuring partner Angela Libby reached out to the League and asked if they needed help. Today, the Brooklyn Debate League is a Davis Polk pro bono client, and lawyers across the firm are regularly involved in supporting the organization with corporate governance, employment and IP advisory services.\n\nTo address the sudden influx of new money, the Brooklyn Debate League incorporated, a change that brought with it a host of new requirements and strategic decisions, with which DiCo was largely unfamiliar. “When the Humans of New York post went viral, we were not a legal entity – we weren’t organized, there was no full-time staff. Suddenly, we could expand and turn this organization and our impact into what we had dreamed of,” DiCo explained. “Our friends at Davis Polk went out of their way to talk to me, answer all of my questions and give me advice. This was my first time running a nonprofit – I didn’t have any experience with the legal documentation necessary, or everything we would need to do to establish ourselves and then stay in compliance once we were up and running.”\n\nOur corporate governance lawyers determined that, under New York nonprofit law, the new corporation’s dramatic overnight increase in valuation exposed it to a range of audit and procedural requirements. We assisted the League in identifying and navigating the relevant regulations and establishing the necessary committees and internal processes to ensure compliance, including drafting an investment policy and a charter for the League’s audit committee.\n\nMembers of the newly appointed board of directors ranged from experienced nonprofit board members to first-timers; our corporate governance work culminated in training this group on nonprofit corporate governance topics including New York state rules, fiduciary duties and practical considerations for board committees.\n\nThe next step was to formally transition from the inaugural board to the first full board of directors, which, per the League’s bylaws, was to be instituted in two staggered classes to ensure continuity. In order to facilitate the transition and address logistical complications that could potentially cause the board to fall below its required membership, our corporate governance lawyers devised a two-step process: first, the members of the old board would sign a unanimous written consent and the non-continuing directors would concurrently tender their resignations by signing letters of resignation that we prepared. Second, the newly appointed board, at their first meeting, would adopt a set of resolutions that we drafted which appointed specific directors to two staggered classes.\n\nDiCo, now Executive Director of the League, also asked for our assistance in drafting a waiver ensuring that the League would own the rights to materials its coaches create on a freelance basis, including handouts, articles, sample cases, research packets and slide decks. While addressing DiCo’s request, our intellectual property lawyers found out that the League’s coaches were not engaged pursuant to any formal employment or independent contractor agreements with the League. To create a framework for clarifying the terms of the coaches’ employment or service, our employment lawyers drafted forms of engagement letters to be used for both employees and independent contractors, and our IP lawyers drafted IP and confidentiality exhibits to the engagement letters to ensure that the League owns all rights to the materials created by the coaches.\n\nToday, the Brooklyn Debate League is flourishing and rapidly growing. Before the influx of donations, the League was mainly operating virtually; now they have expanded to offer in-person programs, have started speech and debate teams at six New York City schools and are even running a summer camp where 80% of participants are on full or near-full scholarships.\n\nOur corporate governance lawyers continue to work closely with the League’s board of directors, who have come to rely on us in an advisory capacity to provide advice on the board’s policies, forming its initial committees and getting the new board up and running. Of our ongoing relationship, DiCo said, “it’s been unbelievably helpful to have the folks at Davis Polk on hand – whenever something comes up and I don’t know what to do, they are the first people I call.”\n\nLearn more about Davis Polk’s Pro Bono program.",

The program aims to improve banks’ ability to combat money laundering.\n\nDan noted that internationally active banks and other financial institutions have for many years wanted to share SARs throughout their global enterprises, to help their anti-money laundering programs.\n\nHe told the WSJ, “Being able to effectively prevent and deter money laundering really depends heavily on being able to share information. If information is siloed…nobody has the full picture.”\n\nHe added, though, that some of the requirements in FinCEN’s proposal could be burdensome, and banks will need to weigh the burdens against the benefits of participating.\n\n“Treasury Wants Banks to Loop in Foreign Affiliates on Suspicious Transactions,” Wall Street Journal (January 24, 2022) (subscription required)\n\n“Banks back plan to share SARs with foreign units.

    "text": "Davis Polk Pro Bono Counsel for Racial Justice Initiatives Diane Lucas recently discussed the firm’s partnership with the nonprofit Promise of Justice Initiative (PJI) on what Diane describes as “one of the most compelling sets of cases that we can work on in the racial justice space.”\n\nWhy did the Pro Bono team choose to work with PJI?\n\nThe Pro Bono team learned of PJI’s Jim Crow Juries: Unanimous Jury Project and immediately recognized one of the most compelling sets of cases that we can work on in the racial justice space. PJI has taken on an unconstitutional law that allowed people to be convicted even when the entire jury did not agree they were guilty. The majority of people in prison because of this law are black and brown. Most of our clients are incarcerated in the Louisiana prison Angola – a former plantation. After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in April 2020 in Ramos v. Louisiana that the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution requires that guilty verdicts for criminal trials be unanimous, 1,500 people became eligible to challenge their convictions. PJI found itself in desperate need of attorneys. It was an easy choice for our team to dive in.\n\nIn May of this year, the Supreme Court found that Ramos is not retroactive as a matter of federal constitutional law, but Louisiana is free to retroactively apply the jury-unanimity rule as a matter of state law. We are continuing our efforts to seek relief from the Louisiana courts and are advocating on behalf of our clients with the District Attorneys.\n\nHow many cases is our team taking on?\n\nIn the last several months, our team has expanded the cases we have taken on to 23 – a huge undertaking. Personally, I wanted to work on these cases because they are directly in line with my mandate for racial justice initiatives. My goal was to help build out this partnership so that we could take on more cases and support the lawyers who were already working hard to put the best case forward for our clients. Our team of 50+ includes Special Counsel for Pro Bono Sharon Katz and Pro Bono Counsel Dara Sheinfeld, who help to supervise the whole project.\n\nIs there a particularly meaningful ongoing case or client outcome you would like to share?\n\nOn March 31, 2021, our client M.D. – convicted in 2008 by a non-unanimous jury and sentenced to life in prison plus 198 years – was resentenced to time served and released, having spent more than 18 years in the Louisiana State Penitentiary at hard labor. Having already served six years awaiting trial, M.D. was found guilty of three counts of armed robbery and sentenced under the Louisiana habitual offender statute. In February, our team and co-counsel from PJI requested a new trial for M.D. The New Orleans District Attorney’s Office offered to waive all objections to the motion and offered a deal in which M.D. pled guilty to a single count of armed robbery. The DA further agreed not to seek a sentence in excess of 25 years and not to pursue a habitual offender sentence. At the resentencing hearing, the judge cited M.D.’s work history and dedication to bettering himself through educational courses while incarcerated as evidence of his rehabilitation.\n\nLearn more about Davis Polk’s Pro Bono program.",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Jesse Solomon was quoted in the Capitol Forum on DOJ’s new self-disclosure safe harbor policy and its potential impact on health care M&A. Under the policy, federal prosecutors will not bring charges if a company voluntarily reports criminal misconduct of the company it acquires within six months from the date of closing. This applies whether the misconduct was discovered pre- or post-acquisition. Companies will then have a baseline of one year from the date of closing to fully remediate the misconduct.\n\n“The policy announced by DAG Monaco sets out standards for reporting by M&A buyers on broad ranges of criminal conduct by acquired businesses, which the buyers have discovered during M&A due diligence and/or integration,” Jesse explained. “Specifically from an antitrust perspective, it is worth noting that this policy is distinct from, and independent of, the Antitrust Division’s own leniency program, which is focused more narrowly on encouraging self-reporting by individuals and corporations for criminal antitrust violations, mostly cartel activity.”\n\nWhen asked how this will impact M&A, Jesse noted, “From my perspective as an antitrust M&A attorney, I am skeptical whether the policy will meaningfully change how we conduct diligence and integration activities. The policy might mean that buyers seek to conduct broader and more thorough due diligence on known exposure risks, but even if the buyer identified such risks and reported them to DOJ promptly, it’s not clear to me that the buyer would benefit. This new policy extends a safe harbor to the buyer, but there is a more ambiguous and conditional standard for the target company – and criminal exposure to the target company would harm the buyer, who now owns the target and will suffer its consequences.”\n\n“Health Care Antitrust Weekly,” Capitol Forum (October 11, 2023) (subscription required)",

    "text": "A Davis Polk team led by partners Ted Polubinski and Brian Burnovski received a shout out in AmLaw Litigation Daily’s “Litigator of the Week” column for securing a complete victory for Weber, Inc. – the leading outdoor cooking company – in a putative federal securities class action. The claims related to Weber’s 2021 initial public offering.\n\nThe complaint was one of the first securities actions seeking to hold a company liable under the securities laws for a post-pandemic falloff in sales. The plaintiff in the case alleged that Weber’s IPO offering materials did not sufficiently warn of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Weber sales, contending that Weber should have disclosed that its pre-IPO sales were a function of a “pull-forward” of replacement grill sales that would not continue after the pandemic.\n\nDavis Polk immediately moved to dismiss, arguing that Weber’s offering materials had disclosed the very trends and risks that the plaintiff claimed were omitted. Davis Polk’s motion also zeroed in on the key statistical comparison that the plaintiff offered in support of his theory that Weber did not sufficiently disclose information about its replacement grill sales. Using publicly filed documents referenced in the complaint, Davis Polk was able to show that the plaintiff had misread two distinct sets of sales data and that the key comparison in his complaint was mathematically and logically flawed.\n\nOn September 27, 2023, less than two months after the motion to dismiss was fully briefed, Judge Elaine E. Bucklo of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois issued a memorandum opinion and order dismissing the complaint in its entirety.\n\nThe Davis Polk team also included counsel Patrick W. Blakemore and associates Adam M. Greene and Cortnay Cymrot.\n\n“Litigator of the Week Runners-Up and Shout Outs,” AmLaw Litigation Daily (September 29, 2023) (subscription required)",

While banks “can never be proactive enough, especially in the sanctions space,” it would probably be premature for them to focus too much attention on potential U.S. sanctions against Chinese targets, Dan said. “One reason for this is because, until such sanctions have actually been issued, it is impossible to know exactly what individuals, entities, geographies, or activities they will cover. Additionally, compliance resources are finite and banks already have their hands full complying with the Russian sanctions.”\n\n“Banks weigh potential response to any U.S. sanctions against China over Russia ties – experts,” Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence (April 18, 2022) (subscription required)",

And I can look to the private sector, to academia, to government, to politics, and beyond, and see other lawyers that I mentored flourishing in their chosen career paths.

Discussing proposals made by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC related to management of large banks’ climate-related financial risks, Margaret said, “They’re all relatively anodyne, in the sense that most banks are already doing that. The way to look at climate risk management, from a bank’s perspective, is credit risk, market risk, liquidity risk. So those proposals are essentially instructing banks to sharpen their pencils a little bit, but not necessarily a huge shift.”\n\nHowever, she notes that the SEC disclosure proposal creates “enormous angst” among public companies, including listed banks in the U.S., “because it is so complex, and because it covers scopes one, two, and three.” Further, she explains, “it’s asking people to do impossible things in an area where the data in the taxonomies are not mature.”\n\n“I think they’re struggling to finalise the proposal because of the many things they’ve learned during the comment process,” she continued. “It goes far beyond anything that’s been proposed.”\n\n“What’s in store for 2023?

The article notes that the senator’s lawyers have said in legal papers that the senator may defend himself in part by claiming that his wife withheld information about her dealings and led him to believe that nothing unlawful was taking place.\n\nTatiana noted that such a tactic would present challenges, given the couple’s public persona as loyal partners who traveled and attended events together. She added that the senator’s lawyers might argue that his wife “did this all on her own; he had no idea; she kept it from him,” but prosecutors could seek to rebut that by introducing evidence of how close the two were.\n\n“They have this great relationship, yet she’s keeping all this from him?” Tatiana said.\n\n“Menendez’s Bribery Trial Puts Scrutiny on His Motives and His Marriage,” New York Times (May 12, 2024) (subscription required)",

Damian noted, “2021 brought an interesting mix of COVID-era restructurings, largely continued from last year and earlier, and post-COVID transactions borne of the incredibly hot market we’ve found ourselves in.” Those hot markets mixed with “historically astonishing amounts of capital being raised and ready to be put to work, and very loose financing documents meant many traditional equitization restructurings were avoided with capital infusions, liability management and amend-and-extend transactions.”\n\nLooking forward, Damian is paying attention to “what, if anything, Congress does with the recent noise around third-party releases coming out of the Purdue and Boy Scouts cases. The reality is third-party releases are a necessary component of many of the toughest restructurings, and the Bankruptcy Code provides a very defined set of rules that limit and provide for court supervision over releases.”\n\nIn closing, Damian discussed the significance of the Purdue Pharma restructuring – in which Davis Polk represents Purdue –  noting it may be the most complex Chapter 11 case in United States history.\n\n“Restructuring Pros Reflect on 2021,” Turnarounds & Workouts (December 2021) (subscription required)",

He provides insights on working with compliance teams as a prosecutor, the DOJ’s updated criteria for evaluating compliance programs, and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-corruption dispositions.\n\nDan served for 11 years in senior roles at DOJ and played a central role in developing enforcement policies on the FCPA, corporate enforcement, compliance and monitors.\n\nWhen asked how he predicts the compliance and enforcement environment will evolve over the next five years, Dan said, “Enforcement trends have remained fairly constant over time. But I do think that technology – including artificial intelligence and methods of communication – will pose both a significant opportunity for compliance programs and enforcement efforts but also tremendous obstacles and challenges. I do not see a good solution to using off-system communications and messaging platforms by employees intent on committing crimes.”\n\nRead the full article\n\nCopyright [2024] CEP Magazine, a publication of the Society of Corporate Compliance and Ethics (SCCE).",

So I prefer to think, not in terms of regulation/deregulation, but basically looking at the efficiency of regulation. And that is what I think is happening or about to happen.”\n\nWhen the hosts questioned how much the crypto industry is in competition with banks, she said, “I don’t think that crypto is [a] 100% competitor to banks … I kind of think we’re going to have two ecosystems living side-by-side in the same way we have non-bank credit living side-by-side with banks.”\n\nDiscussing how much regulation matters to banks, Margaret noted that it isn’t the only important piece to look at: “I think … what’s happening in the economy, what’s happening in what I’ll call regulatory change – because regulations that are set, folks have adjusted to it – and then the intensity of supervision, all three of those are going to have an impact on the banking sector and what they do.”\n\nWhen asked what should get more attention in order to prevent another bank crisis, Margaret said, “Deposit insurance reform. And that’s going to take Congress. I think there are two or three very simple things that Congress could do that would prevent the kind of panicked run that we saw last time. They could raise the insurance limit index for inflation; they could raise it a lot for what I’ll call operational accounts, for religious institutions, for charities, for small- and medium-sized businesses. There is an amount that could be chosen so that next time we don’t have this ‘pulling out’ of deposits.”\n\n“What Trump 2.0 Means for Banks, Crypto and More,” Wall Street Journal’s Take on the Week (January 19, 2025)",

Up until the orders from the SEC came in with the official approval, Joe was “hopeful, but certainly not positive” that the green light was coming.\n\n“A lot of the effort in the past four to five months has been gaming out every possible way that this could unfold, making sure that we had a strategy to counter if it was going in a way we thought would leave us in an unfair position,” Joe explained.\n\nNow that a bitcoin exchange-traded product has made it to the market, Joe noted that he expects those focused on crypto financial products will turn their attention to issuers proposing to hold ether, the token underpinning the ethereum blockchain.\n\n“The challenge there is the SEC has still never said that they agree that ethereum is not a security, and so that I think is where the focus is going to be now,” he said.\n\n“How A Davis Polk Atty Helped A Bitcoin ETF Across The Line,” Law360 (January 11, 2024)",

Compliance was always something that would be asked about when determining whether a company should get credit in connection with a resolution, what type of resolution was appropriate and whether a monitor should be imposed. However, the types of questions that were asked by DOJ prosecutors and the presentations that were made by defense counsel when I first started were not very detailed, nuanced or sophisticated.”\n\n“Dan Kahn Reflects on the DOJ’s Compliance Evolution,” Anti-Corruption Report (May 25, 2022) (subscription required)",

I think the biggest takeaway of this bill becoming law is that you’ll see greater institutional adoption of the stablecoin product because it will be federally regulated. And greater institutional adoption means that there is more market demand and that means there’s more room for innovation. So, I think it is a net-net positive.”\n\nDavid noted, “The real promise of this bill is to unlock innovation. Because once you have a product that is federally regulated, all types of innovators can think of how they can layer onto that product to allow consumers to access money more quickly, to make payments more quickly, to send money around the world more quickly.”\n\nAsked about where this bill would put the U.S. compared to other countries in terms of crypto regulation, he said, “We’ll be catching up to some and leading others. During the Biden administration we really had a flashing red light to not do much and that will change. We’ll now have a green light to innovate and develop products.”\n\nExplaining how this bill will ensure that consumers are protected, David said, “There are provisions in the bill to protect [consumers]. One, in terms of making the reserves backing the stablecoins safe and limited to a small band of assets like Treasury securities and deposits at banks. And two, there are provisions of what we call ‘preference’ for stablecoin holders, so if a stablecoin issuer were to go into insolvency, the holders of the stablecoin have priority in recovering before other creditors.

    "text": "Davis Polk partner David Portilla discussed the proposed raise of U.S. capital requirements for banks on Bloomberg Television’s “The Close.”\n\nWhen asked about the proposed rules’ effects on banks, David noted that there are a few aspects that have a more significant effect on trading operations and businesses that attract fee income as opposed to interest income. “The proposals have something called the operational risk aspect of capital, which will be new in the U.S. and that capital requirement will essentially impose a capital charge on fee income that a bank organization attracts from its asset-light businesses,” David said. “It will be a big part of the discussion about whether these are appropriately calibrated.”\n\nHe also explained the differing views on how to calculate risk. David noted that the largest banks currently calculate their capital requirements using two methods – one that uses the bank’s own models to figure out how to capitalize its risks and the “standardized approach,” which uses what the regulators have determined. “This proposal would, for credit risk, eliminate the models-based approach, and whether and how that’s done is a question that everyone will discuss as these proposals are outstanding,” he said.\n\nAs for the differences between the two approaches, David explained, “The way it gets discussed often times is the risk of homogeneity in a regulator-set approach where the regulators set it and they’re the only ones thinking about it … and the models-based approach, where you get the benefit of banks looking at things in different ways and diversity of thought and diversity of analysis. The current regulators would say the banks always estimate low.”\n\nHe also noted that another issue that has been discussed prominently is how the proposals manage risks. “Those who look skeptically on the proposals would say you’re just pushing risk outside of the banking system, and that’s net-net or worse off for that. I think proponents of the proposals would say that may be the case, but we will have to go find a way to regulate those risks outside the banking system using other tools that are available.”\n\nDavid mentioned that this process could take awhile and that it may be some time before these proposed rules would go into effect. “There’s a comment period where the public gets to analyze these proposals and give their comments to the regulators. That goes until November 30th, and then it’s going to take awhile for the regulators to sift through all those comments.”\n\n“Bloomberg Markets: The Close,” Bloomberg Television (starting at the 1:41:15 mark) (July 31, 2023)",

Warning not to read too much into the Court’s motivations, Ashok called the Supreme Court a “black box in that regard.”\n\n“I could see some institutional desire for the justices to position themselves to take up the cases before them rather than reaching out and deciding related questions that may arise,” Ashok said. “I don’t think we can assume that they lack the votes to take up that question.”\n\n“Discovery Rule Dodge Puts Justices’ Damages Ruling on Thin Ice,” Bloomberg Law (May 13, 2024)",

There have been several significant outbound deal announcements and we are seeing an increasing pipeline of such deals.”\n\n“The demographic issues facing Japan are galvanising Japanese companies across almost all industry sectors to focus on outbound investment,” Ken continued. “The rapidly ageing and declining population means that companies in industries ranging from consumer products and food and beverage to insurance, asset management, manufacturing and home-building all need to invest overseas for growth.”\n\nKen also noted that there are shifting cultural norms at the company level. “In the past, a common complaint about Japanese companies was that they were not able to move quickly enough to participate in a standard international sales process, or to satisfy a typical international counterparty,” he said. “I believe that many Japanese companies have made significant progress on this front, both by developing their internal talent by engaging in more frequent domestic and international M&A, and also by hiring external talent for key positions in their corporate development and legal functions.”\n\n“Appetite for M&A,” Asia Business Law Journal (August 6, 2024)",

Michael noted that the reason GPs started applying the offset only to the fund’s portion of the equity is because they saw LPs receiving the “windfall,” and that the debate over the offsets has been going on for a decade.\n\n“When I started introducing it [into fund documents] a decade ago, there was minimal to little pushback,” Michael said. Even today, he observed that out of 20 or 30 LPs he negotiates with on fund terms, only one or two of them push back on the arrangement.\n\nGPs have a “fairly rational, logical argument,” he continued. “The offset should be commensurate with the reduction in value you’re suffering from the extraction of the fee, that’s why it’s done based on the fund’s proportionate ownership of the company.”\n\nNow, LPs are in a position to push back on certain fund terms. “The terms negotiations have been decidedly LP-friendly at a scale I don’t really think I’ve ever seen before,” Michael said. “It’s a very emboldened community. Certain LPs see an opportunity to reset certain terms and they are taking advantage.”\n\n“Deal fee offsets and the rise of LP power in negotiations,” Buyouts (July 26, 2024) (subscription required)",

The award will be presented at WhyHunger’s “Come Together” event on October 19, 2021, in New York.\n\nRead more about the project in Rolling Stone here",

This is the fourth time in eight years that Davis Polk’s finance practice has been recognized at the Chambers USA Awards.\n\nIn announcing the win, Chambers notes that Davis Polk “is renowned in the market for its incredibly strong bench and ability to handle high profile and complex matters. The group has been involved in a number of notable deals this year, including Vista Equity Partners and Elliott Investment Management’s acquisition of Citrix, as well as the financing for Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter.” Quoting a client, the write-up goes on to note, “Davis Polk & Wardwell is the representation of choice to handle complex structures or unique situations, especially if multiple jurisdictions are involved.”\n\nIn 2022, Davis Polk advised on 137 U.S. syndicated deals totaling more than $302 billion, including seven of the year’s nine largest leveraged acquisition financings. We also represented a broad range of direct lenders in numerous direct lending transactions, including unitranche, recurring revenue, and preferred equity transactions.\n\nDavis Polk’s broad market-leading practice allows us to provide advice that anticipates market trends and protects against emerging vulnerabilities. The firm’s ability to field teams for both syndicated and direct lending solutions ensures maximum flexibility and optimal execution for all parties.\n\nThe 2023 Chambers USA Awards were presented on June 15, 2023.",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Frances Bivens discussed the key trends and developments in mass tort litigation with Corporate Disputes as part of the publication’s July-September 2025 issue.\n\nIn the Q&A, Frances noted that “one trend that has been developing over the last several years is state courts appointing receivers over mass tort defendants, both solvent and insolvent, that resist producing documents and other information regarding both liability and insurance coverage, for jurisdictional and other reasons.”\n\nShe also added that “PFAS litigation is on the rise and is one notable area where claims are increasing and where new claims continue to be brought. It is likely that this type of mass tort litigation will continue to evolve over the next few years, with new claims and new products being brought into litigation.”\n\nWhen asked how she foresees the mechanics of mass tort litigation evolving in the months and years ahead, Frances said, “In the U.S., the mass tort system is already quite evolved, with multi-district litigation, mass tort bankruptcy schemes, experienced counsel, judges and mediators, specialized courts for very large mass torts like asbestos, and statutes to deal with nuclear power, wildfires and other mass torts raising public policy implications. Certain ‘judicial [problem areas]’ in the U.S. raise issues of tort reform to contain the size of verdicts or curb the use of punitive damages. While some steps may be taken, I don’t think we will see wholesale change to the system, like loser-pay rules or an end to the right to a jury trial.”\n\nRead the full article",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner and Financial Institutions practice head Margaret Tahyar’s testimony before the House Financial Services Committee was quoted in American Banker, the Bank Policy Institute and the National Law Journal.\n\nOn April 29, 2025, Margaret testified before the House Financial Services Committee’s Subcommittee on Financial Institutions at a hearing on “Regulatory Overreach: The Price Tag on American Prosperity,” which explored reforms to increase accountability in bank supervision and enhance interagency coordination.\n\nAmerican Banker highlighted an exchange between House Financial Services Committee Chair French Hill and Margaret. Chairman Hill asked if the FDIC’s appeals process lacked independence and contained inadequate oversight. Margaret responded, “The appeals process is clearly broken.”\n\nShe said that while “many examiners do a great job,” the internal appeals process is flawed because it involves senior personnel overseeing disputes rather than a neutral oversight body. “Appeals should be rare but fair,” she added.\n\nThe Bank Policy Institute noted another exchange between Chairman Hill and Margaret. He asked, “Would you agree that tailoring regulations for well managed institutions already exists in law, and it’s just not being implemented by our supervisors?” She answered, “Yes, I agree it does exist in the law from the previous act, but we don’t know how it is being implemented by supervisors in practice because of the culture of secrecy, but based on the anecdotal evidence, I think it is being inconsistently implemented.”\n\nAnother moment highlighted by the Bank Policy Institute was a question by Representative Blake Moore, who asked, “Do you think there’s a credible, objective way to measure reputational risk, or is [it] inherently just too subjective to remain part of the supervisory framework?” Margaret said, “It’s inherently too subjective. It’s new. Let’s remember how new it is. It didn’t exist 20 years ago. Doesn’t add anything to existing risks. For example, Bank Secrecy Act, anti-money laundering, terrorist financing, they’re all already covered. And I just think experience has shown that it cannot be objectively supervised or managed.”\n\nBoth the Bank Policy Institute and the National Law Journal highlighted Margaret’s warning about secrecy within the examination process. The National Law Journal quoted her, testifying that a “culture of secrecy” exists among banking agencies that makes it hard to know whether or how the law is being implemented. “In my view, the executive branch and the agencies should not wait for Congress to act but should start their own process of reform now,” she said.\n\nThe Bank Policy Institute quoted her testimony, saying, “There are many unknowns in supervision. Is it effective? Does it work? In business as usual or in troubled times? We actually don’t know. That is because it’s not transparent. Why isn’t it more transparent? I’m not suggesting body cams on examiners, but there are some things that could be done that are relatively easy. One is to release very old exam reports, 35 years or more, where nobody was at the bank or at the agencies is still working. Another is to release more consistent anonymized aggregate data that will allow an examination into whether exams are consistent and fair across banks or models and whether tailoring works. Another is to reform the appeals process, which is broken. As Secretary Bessent recently said, it’s more theoretical than real. In a 13-year period at the FDIC, there were 50 appeals to over 100,000 exams, and I don’t think anybody’s that perfect. There were very few wins last year. Banks were one to 17.”\n\n“GOP lawmakers mull eliminating ‘management’ from CAMELS,” American Banker (April 29, 2025) (subscription required)\n\n“10 Takeaways from the House Hearing on Regulatory Overreach,” Bank Policy Institute (April 29, 2025)\n\n“Republicans Slam ‘One-Size-Fits-All’ Banking Regs, Promote Deregulation,” National Law Journal (April 29, 2025) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Dan Stipano was quoted in Law360 Tax Authority discussing the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network’s (FinCEN) new reporting requirements for small businesses that are set to go into effect in five months. However, several members of Congress and attorneys have expressed concern that many small businesses affected by the disclosure rules may not know what their obligations are under the new regulations.\n\nDan noted that given FinCEN’s limited resources, it may look for some egregious outliers to make a point for enforcing penalties for noncompliance, rather than attempting to put out every fire. However, he does not agree with “consciousness raised by enforcement actions,” he said. “There really should be a major effort aimed at public education so that nobody inadvertently stumbles into a trap.”\n\nPart of the revised regulations include rules on beneficial ownership under the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). Banks are currently subject to a customer due diligence rule that requires them to identify and verify the beneficial owners of companies. Under the CTA, FinCEN may require banks to confirm that their customers have submitted to the database of beneficial ownership information. Dan said, “[The process is] totally circular, and you can’t use the information for anything else.” He added that there’s no mechanism in place to verify the accuracy of the information in the FinCEN database.\n\nDan shared that the regulations are both under- and overinclusive due to the exemption of large operating companies. “The rules are overinclusive because they’re going to sweep in lots of businesses that present basically zero risk of money laundering or terrorist financing,” he said. “At the same time, the guidance’s definition of a large operating company isn’t really such a large company.”\n\nHe added, “If you are a sophisticated money launderer, that is a loophole you can drive a truck through.”\n\n“Small Businesses May Be In The Dark About FinCEN Rules,” Law360 Tax Authority (August 8, 2023) (subscription required)",

Counsel and Head of Racial Justice Pro Bono Diane Lucas accepted the award on the firm’s behalf.\n\nAt the request of the public defense firm New York County Defender Services (NYCDS), Davis Polk developed the concept for an expansive writ project aimed at providing relief to individuals incarcerated at Rikers and building general awareness of the prison complex’s poor conditions. We recruited five other New York law firms to join the effort, led a training for all volunteers and committed Davis Polk’s resources to support the infrastructure that would make this project possible.\n\nOnce established, NYCDS directed its Rikers Island inmate case flow to Davis Polk’s Pro Bono team, which distributed cases among our own lawyers and volunteering lawyers from participating firms. Using a template brief that the Davis Polk team drafted, lawyers filed writs of habeas corpus on behalf of their clients demonstrating that Rikers had failed to keep them safe, and co-counseled with NYCDS in the court proceedings that followed.\n\nDavis Polk handled a case on behalf of a man with severe mental illness who was viciously beaten by other individuals incarcerated at Rikers and denied necessary medical and psychiatric care. With the Davis Polk team’s advocacy, which included drafting the writ and accompanying affidavits, preparing the client for the hearing, directing his testimony on the stand, and delivering arguments before the court, our client was granted a very favorable plea deal in a pending case and transferred to a safer facility.\n\nLearn more about Davis Polk’s Pro Bono program.",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Michael Flynn was quoted in Law360 regarding the potential path forward for Slack, following a Ninth Circuit panel’s ruling related to the company’s direct listing. The panel ruled that a Slack shareholder can pursue its challenge of the accuracy of Slack’s registration statement, even though the plaintiff could not trace his share purchases to the registration statement. The case is one of first impression, addressing whether shareholders who purchase shares through a direct listing process have standing to challenge a registration statement under the federal securities laws. Michael noted that if Slack petitions for a rehearing and that petition is denied, or if it is granted and the Ninth Circuit panel’s result is affirmed, “it is likely that the company would file a petition for cert in the Supreme Court seeking further review.”\n\n“Slack’s Direct Listing Ruling Could Have Far-Reaching Impact,” Law360 (October 22, 2021) (subscription required)\n\nRead Davis Polk’s September 23, 2021, client update on the ruling.",

The U.S. criminal penalty also reflects a 30% discount off the bottom of the applicable U.S. sentencing guidelines range as a result of the companies’ exemplary cooperation and remediation. The DOJ also concluded that no independent compliance monitor was warranted.\n\nThe Davis Polk team also included senior counsel Denis J. McInerney, counsel Jordan Leigh Smith, Nino Stamatovic and David B.

Since sanctions rules typically focus on the movement of physical assets to sanctioned jurisdictions, compliance with the sanctions regime has not always been a major priority at financial institutions, he noted.\n\nHe said that while the whistleblower program could provide prosecutors with new information, it may not have a “huge practice impact,” considering the increased attention other federal agencies are already giving to money laundering and sanctions evasion.\n\n“It may, on the margins, result in only a few extra cases, but some of those cases may be very important,” Will said. “Anything that provides an avenue to get information, particularly about the most serious violations, is a good thing.”\n\n“Treasury eyes bank whistleblowers as it steps up sanctions enforcement,” American Banker (November 5, 2023) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk today announced that William J. Hochul, Jr., a veteran federal prosecutor, former General Counsel of a highly diversified, government-regulated global business, and prior member of the board of directors of a large healthcare provider and employer, has joined the firm’s White Collar Defense & Investigations practice in New York as counsel.\n\n“We are delighted to welcome Bill to the Firm,” said Neil Barr, Davis Polk’s Managing Partner. “He is a highly respected lawyer whose long and distinguished history of public service, record of board service and experience as a General Counsel make him especially attuned to the needs of our clients.”\n\nAt Davis Polk, Mr. Hochul will advise clients on a range of matters, including complex government and internal investigations, crisis management, communications strategy and risk mitigation.\n\nMr. Hochul most recently served, from November 2016 until August 2023, as Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary of Delaware North Companies, the multinational food service, gaming and hospitality company headquartered in Buffalo, New York. As General Counsel, Mr. Hochul oversaw the company’s legal function, leading an international team of lawyers, and provided advice and counsel to senior management in all legal matters involving Delaware North or its operating companies.\n\nPrior to that role, Mr. Hochul served for nearly 30 years in various roles at the U.S. Department of Justice. In 2009, President Obama nominated Mr. Hochul to serve as the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of New York, a position he held following the Senate’s unanimous confirmation until 2016. As U.S. Attorney, Mr. Hochul oversaw the prosecution of all federal criminal cases brought within the 17 counties of Western New York and also directed and supervised all other matters occurring in the District in which the United States was a party.\n\nFrom 1991 until 2010, Mr. Hochul served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Western District of New York. He first joined the Department in 1987 as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. During his tenure as an AUSA, Mr. Hochul successfully investigated and prosecuted hundreds of companies and individuals engaged in a variety of federal and other offenses, including money laundering, racketeering, terrorism, and sophisticated financial and violent schemes. He also advised foreign governments on investigating matters including corruption and money laundering.\n\nMr. Hochul said, “I look forward to joining Davis Polk’s formidable white collar defense team and working together to help clients navigate their most complex investigations and advisory matters.”\n\nThe recipient of numerous awards and honors from governmental and community groups, Mr. Hochul notably was awarded the Attorney General’s Award for Exceptional Service – the highest award conferred by the Department of Justice – in recognition of his work as an AUSA to dismantle the Lackawanna Six, as well as a Service to America Award, presented by the Partnership for Public Service.\n\nMr. Hochul is a frequent lecturer, in the United States and internationally, on numerous topics, and has taught law school classes as an adjunct professor, most recently on corporate crisis response. Mr. Hochul has served as a director on multiple boards, including that of Kaleida Health, Western New York’s largest healthcare provider and employer.\n\nMr. Hochul earned his J.D. from the University at Buffalo School of Law and B.A. from the University of Notre Dame.",

But the interconnection queues are massively backed up, and the transmission grid is just so grossly outdated that the time and potentially the cost of getting that power to the data centers can be a challenge.”\n\nThe article noted that the advancement of small modular reactors (SMRs) is attracting the attention of data center companies, but that they might not be readily available until 2029 or 2030. David said, “Data center consumers are still willing to buy them just because they kind of want that certainty of supply even if it’s multiple years out.”\n\n“Data centres and AI: Solving the power puzzle,” IJGlobal (January 7, 2025) (subscription required)",

It really employs some cutting-edge deal technology,” Frank explained. “What you’re trying to do essentially with the structure at a high level is drop the IP, technology or general intangibles down into a vehicle. The intangibles should be mission critical so that the borrower really can’t survive without them, and then you put them in some sort of vehicle where you have bankruptcy remoteness so that if the borrower or the issuer becomes distressed, all of the incentives are there on assumption rather than rejection.”\n\n“Use your best assets to fund your business - Frank J.

In the Q&A, Tsiouris discusses her road to partnership, what she believes to be the keys to successful business development and her advice to up-and-coming associates, among other topics. “Business development has to work for your personality and be genuine,” Tsiouris said. “I’ve found that smaller, focused meetings with my clients help them to get to know me more and really provide a window into my thinking. Others prefer large group settings and have more success that way. Do what makes you comfortable.”\n\n“How I Made Partner: ‘Be Consistent.

    "text": "The American Lawyer has honored Davis Polk partner James Rouhandeh as a “Litigator of the Year.” Rouhandeh, head of the firm’s Litigation Department, was recognized for his precedent-setting appellate victories in the Second and Fifth Circuit Courts of Appeal.\n\nHe argued for and obtained a landmark ruling from the Fifth Circuit holding a law firm client immune from a multibillion-dollar class action brought by thousands of investors in what turned out to be a massive Ponzi scheme run by R. Allen Stanford. The Fifth Circuit held—for the first time—that the Texas attorney immunity doctrine is a true immunity from suit and not merely an affirmative defense. The decision ended seven years of litigation in federal district court, the Fifth Circuit, and the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nRouhandeh also secured a key appellate win for the securities industry when he successfully argued in the Second Circuit on behalf of the lead underwriters of the Facebook IPO. Plaintiffs sought to recover over $100 million in alleged short-swing profits from the underwriters. After the Second Circuit invited the SEC to submit an amicus brief as to the critical legal issues in the case, both sides advocated their legal positions to the SEC, which ultimately supported the position of the lead underwriters. The Second Circuit held that requiring disgorgement would impair the process for public securities offerings and discourage IPOs.\n\n“Litigator of the Year: James Rouhandeh of Davis Polk & Wardwell,” The American Lawyer  (January 2018)",

There was no history of how things were done, so you got to think about what the right way to do it, unburdened by historical practices. Because it’s an inter-agency council, we worked really closely with staff from across the government. The issues were really hard and a lot of them are still being debated today, which shows you how challenging some of the questions are.”\n\nWhen asked about a recent FSOC rule change regarding the designation of individual firms as SIFIs, he explained that “the way they seem to be thinking about it is, we should look at activities but we should have the ability to [designate], depending on the circumstances.”\n\nDavid also noted that there has been a slight pivot to the asset management sector. “When you look at the comments of Under Secretary [Nellie] Liang, Secretary Yellen and Chair [Gary] Gensler at the SEC, they seem to be saying: ‘There are broad-based practices that we believe deserve attention,’” he said, “The one they talk about the most in their speeches is margining practices for bilateral uncleared repo. That implies an activities-based type of analysis.”\n\nAsked if he thinks there are a lot more designations coming soon, David responded, “That depends on the activity or the issue that’s being analyzed. Is it an issue that lends itself to a broad-based activities centered policy response? Or is there some entity out there that is sui generis and needs an entity based-response? That seems to be the mindset they have.”\n\nSwitching topics to bank merger policy, David said, “Figuring out how to, again, strike that balance so there are opportunities for healthy consolidation, is important. If policy makers have constructed a framework that applies more stringent regulation to firms, in theory it should be okay for them to be a little bit bigger because they’re now subject to this more stringent regulation.”\n\n“Davis Polk’s Portilla Talks FSOC and Whether Fund Giants Are Really In Its Crosshairs,” Capitol Account (June 9, 2023)",

The Davis Polk team addressed practical considerations for companies in adopting and administering the new required clawback policies, as well as some of the thorny issues that have been raised. Topics discussed included officers whose compensation is subject to clawback, events that trigger clawbacks, compensation arrangements that are subject to clawback, recovery, the financial restatement process and various disclosure obligations.\n\n“SEC Clawback Rule Requires Focused, Coordinated Compliance,” Anti-Corruption Report (August 2, 2023)",

The piece, published in the Center’s publication, The Practice, examines movement in the AmLaw 100 and the differences that allowed some firms to “improve their strategic positioning vis-à-vis their competitors.”\n\nIn the interview, Neil discusses how Davis Polk thinks about firm strategy and how that has evolved. “We went through an evolution over the last decade to operate much more like a business. During that time we involved our partnership in the economics of the business, making sure performance was where we wanted it to be, and we did a bit of portfolio shaping,” Neil said.\n\nNeil goes on to address his approach to communication within the partnership of strategic efforts and changes, noting that an important part of this communication includes framing the firm’s value system and culture “because that’s the architecture on which we are building our business.”\n\nLooking to the future of the legal industry, Neil predicts that “the law firms that overperform going forward will do so on the basis of characteristics that are different from those of the last 15 years or so – meaning that brand and prestige will be a part of the story, but strategy, operational efficiency, and other such issues will increasingly play a role in firms’ financial performance.”\n\n“Leading the Way,” The Practice (May/June 2023)",

He noted that, at the time, company boards were pressuring executives to jump into AI but that “there wasn’t a lot of thinking about what that means from a risk perspective.”\n\nThe article highlights that AI touches nearly every area of law, and although copyright cases involving AI training models are dominating the current headlines, there are broader challenges ahead. David noted that the current moment is “just the beginning” of a much larger wave of litigation.\n\nWhen asked what the keys to success are in high-stakes litigation, David said, “The trick to it is really balancing and staying on top of the details while keeping an eye on the big picture.” He emphasized how he always tells junior lawyers that his formula for success has always been “become an expert in something.”\n\n“The world is obsessed with AI.

This is expected to encourage more M&A activity and boost private equity interest in Japan.\n\n“Although these are ‘soft law’ guidelines that are not legally binding, they provide a useful framework of analysis for companies, investors, investment bankers and lawyers to analyse and guide their behaviour in connection with corporate takeovers,” Ken added.\n\n“Japan’s PE market expected to fly high,” IFLR (July 21, 2023) (subscription required)",

When you’re talking about floating-rate debt, many floating-rate loans have interest-rate caps that expire prior to loan maturity.”\n\nBrian added that given the now high cost to replace expired rate caps, the situation could put some loans into distress before they reach maturity, exacerbating the overall issue of distressed debt. “I think you’ll see more of that,” he said about loans with expired interest-rate caps hitting distress prior to maturity.\n\nNoting that one hurdle to getting new deals done is that it is difficult for banks to underwrite transactions with so few transactions happening, Brian said, “It’s hard for anyone to resolve any of this until there is a sense of pricing in the market. With very few transactions, it’s hard to get consensus on … what an appropriate price point is. I think you’re going to continue to see [CMBS] loans being transferred to special servicing.”\n\n“CMBS Market ‘Underwater’ Amid Soaring Interest Rates,” Law360 Real Estate Authority (October 5, 2023) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner and Investment Management head Leor Landa was quoted from the fourth annual Buyouts secondaries roundtable discussing the secondaries market.\n\nDiscussing the appetite for GP-led transactions, Leor said, “There are lots of secular reasons for the popularity of GP-leds, each of which exists outside of a particular market moment. The first is the big shift in liquidity generally out of public markets and into private markets, and that is not changing. We have also seen this drop in M&A and IPO activity whereby secondaries are providing a great outlet for liquidity at a time when LPs are clamoring for distributions. That has drawn sponsors to the opportunities created by having secondary exits as an additional tool in the toolchest, using continuation vehicles as a fourth exit option. There are reasons why on certain deals it makes sense for a GP to maintain control for longer.”\n\nLeor noted that GP-leds are also being used by mid-market managers to create distributions where successful deals have become oversized relative to assets under management. “There are lots of things running parallel that make these really attractive,” he said. “And the infrastructure has now been built out, and the best practice developed, to allow more and more LPs and GPs to get comfortable with these processes.”\n\nSpeaking about how early GP-led deals were a reaction to a moment in time when good assets caught up in the financial crisis had depreciated in value and LPs wanted liquidity, Leor said, “We thought we would get through a tough spot and then put the tool back in the toolbox, but we were completely wrong. The secondaries market has grown through the downcycle in M&A and IPOs, and through the upcycles in M&A and IPOs. It has proven to be a consistently growing market that is not context dependent.”\n\nLeor added, “We’ve been saying for some time that credit secondaries would be the next big thing given the size of the private credit market. We are certainly seeing more take-up now and more focus on the buy-side with people willing to look at credit portfolios. We’re expecting more steady growth.”\n\nRemarking on the rise in the number of 40 Act funds, Leor said, “This is a logical extension of what we have seen over the past decade in private equity, private credit and hedge funds, and it is starting to accelerate because some of the benefits of secondaries work well for that investor base. Secondary funds seek to mitigate the J-curve by being able to deploy capital faster, generating a higher velocity of returns and more visibility into liquidity and timing of distributions. Those strategies line up well with a more retail investor base, and we are expecting that market to continue to grow.”\n\nThe article noted that while the SEC’s proposed Private Fund Adviser Rules are dead, the policy concerns behind the proposals to regulate continuation fund deals remain. Leor added, “An important mitigant of those regulatory concerns is a properly intermediated market process for real price discovery with a sophisticated third-party adviser on board to help position the transaction.”\n\nLooking forward to 2025, Leor believes secondaries will continue to represent a relative bright spot in the fundraising market as people are drawn to the attractions of the asset class.\n\n“We expect fundraising generally in private markets to improve in 2025, and I think secondaries will outperform as people try to allocate more capital to it,” he added. “Even with a rebound in M&A activity and the return of IPOs, we still expect the volume in secondaries to increase meaningfully.”\n\n“Secondaries roundtable sees boom continuing: ‘This is not a market moment’,” Buyouts (December 2, 2024)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Michael Hong was quoted in Private Equity Law Report discussing contractual mechanisms that GPs pursue to limit the scope and likelihood of clawbacks as well as ways they improve their ability to hold current and former employees accountable for their respective shares of clawback obligations.\n\nSpeaking about alterative GP clawback formulations, Michael noted, “It is worth emphasizing that the push in negotiations to omit LPs’ preferred return from GP clawback obligations is not common among GPs.”\n\nThe article noted that the most common approach is for GPs to cap clawback obligations to the amount of carried interest that was improperly received, net of any income taxes paid or accrued on those proceeds. “For example, if a GP receives a $100 carried interest distribution from a fund and then pays $30 of it to the government in taxes, then the maximum amount LPs can recoup under a clawback provision is $70,” he explained.\n\nHowever, he pointed out that a common problem is that many fund managers incorrectly assume that their clawback obligation itself is “after-tax.” “In the scenario where a fund manager received $100 of carry but only netted $70 after tax, if the clawback is for $50, then the manager needs to pay that entire $50 to its LPs,” Michael explained.\n\nMichael continued, “Those LPs are basically saying, ‘the tax proceeds are your problem, not mine,’ which is the first time I’ve seen LPs take that stance in my years in the industry.”\n\nDiscussing deferred carry distributions, Michael noted that “a deferment provision is a win-win from LPs’ perspective as it reduces the risk of a clawback and results in them receiving more cash earlier. As a result, most well-drafted private fund LPAs [limited partnership agreements] include the mechanism, and with minimal pushback from LPs.”\n\nNoting that it is common for GP agreements to include a provision allowing the GP to hold back a portion of any carried interest distributions owed to applicable current and former employees, Michael said the proceeds are held in an escrow account. “Of course, if the GP thinks the fund is doing well and a clawback is unlikely, it might release the escrow funds to keep its employees happy,” he added.\n\n“Protections GPs Negotiate in LPAs and With Senior Personnel to Curb the Burden of Clawback Obligations (Part Two of Two),” Private Equity Law Report (April 17, 2025) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk today announced that preeminent white collar practitioner and former senior government official Neil MacBride has rejoined the firm as a partner in Washington DC. Mr. MacBride, who will become co-chair of Davis Polk’s White Collar Defense & Investigations practice, returns to the firm after serving for more than two years as General Counsel of the U.S. Department of Treasury, where he advised on a wide range of domestic and international priorities critical to the United States.\n\n“We are thrilled to welcome Neil back to the firm,” said Neil Barr, Davis Polk’s Managing Partner. “Neil’s combination of extensive experience in senior government roles and many years as one of the leading white collar defense practitioners and trial lawyers is unmatched. He will be a key member of our distinguished white collar practice and invaluable to clients trusting Davis Polk with their critical investigations and enforcement matters and most sensitive business and legal matters.”\n\nAt Davis Polk, Mr. MacBride will again represent clients in high-stakes white collar matters, including trials, government enforcement actions, and congressional and internal investigations, as well as complex civil litigation and regulatory matters. He also will help to further develop the firm’s national security investigations practice, representing clients in matters relating to CFIUS, anti-money laundering, sanctions and export controls.\n\nAppointed by President Biden and confirmed by the Senate, Mr. MacBride was sworn in as General Counsel of the Treasury Department on February 22, 2022. In this role, Mr. MacBride served as the chief legal officer of the Department and the principal legal adviser to the Secretary of Treasury and senior leaders on a wide range of issues relating to domestic finance, terrorism finance, financial crimes enforcement, international economic affairs and tax policy. He also served as head of the Treasury Legal Division, supervising more than 2,000 attorneys across the Department. In 2024, Secretary Janet Yellen presented Mr. MacBride with the Alexander Hamilton Award, the highest honor bestowed by the Treasury Department.\n\nMr. MacBride joined the Department after eight years as a Davis Polk litigation partner, during which time he co-led the firm’s White Collar Defense & Investigations practice and served as head of the Washington DC office.\n\n“Neil is one of the country’s most respected lawyers, and what distinguishes Neil is the breadth of issues for which clients rely on his advice, whether criminal, civil or regulatory, and whether in a courtroom, with government agencies or in the halls of Congress,” said Greg Andres, co-head of Davis Polk’s White Collar Defense & Investigations practice. “We are delighted that he has rejoined our team and look forward to working alongside him to help clients through their most pressing issues.”\n\n“I am grateful for my time at Treasury and honored to have had the opportunity to serve under Secretary Yellen,” Mr. MacBride said. “Davis Polk is a very special firm. Our white collar and government investigations lawyers are exceptional, and I am thrilled to again call them my colleagues. I look forward to helping clients navigate the complex legal and regulatory landscape and working with them to find effective solutions.”\n\nPrior to originally joining Davis Polk in 2014, Mr. MacBride served as U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. During his tenure as U.S. Attorney, he led the office in bringing cases of national and international significance, involving financial fraud, international corruption, copyright infringement and trade secret theft, defense procurement fraud, money laundering, terrorism and cybersecurity.\n\nBefore his appointment as U.S. Attorney, Mr. MacBride served as Associate Deputy Attorney General at the Department of Justice in 2009. He also served as Chief Counsel and Staff Director for then-Senator Biden from 2001 to 2005 on the Senate Judiciary Committee. From 1997 to 2001, Mr. MacBride served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the District of Columbia. During his time as an Assistant U.S. Attorney and as U.S. Attorney for EDVA, he conducted more than 25 jury trials.\n\nEarlier in his career, Mr. MacBride served as General Counsel of the Business Software Alliance, an international trade association for the hardware and software industry.",

Rishty noted that, with permanent shutdowns of some hotels in New York, owners, developers and investors are looking for ways to repurpose them. When asked about the 1031 Exchange program, a popular way for investors to reinvest sale proceeds into a new property and in doing so defer payment of capital gains tax, Lichter said, “it remains to be seen whether there can be common ground on that in Congress.”\n\n“3 Areas of Real Estate to Watch in 2021,” Law360 (January 3, 2021) (subscription required)",

    "text": "We secured a permanent injunction and $6.13 million settlement from UCLA\n\nDavis Polk represented the plaintiffs in a lawsuit against UCLA regarding campus encampments that forcibly barred Jewish students and faculty from areas of the UCLA campus on the basis of their Jewish identity and religious beliefs. On July 29, 2025, United States District Judge Mark C. Scarsi entered a consent judgment and permanent injunction against UCLA barring it from excluding Jews from the UCLA campus, UCLA’s campus programs or UCLA’s campus activities. The consent judgment is part of a broader settlement that will also see UCLA pay $6.13 million, including damages to the plaintiffs, millions in charitable contributions to organizations that support the Jewish community and attorneys’ fees and costs. The settlement is believed to be the largest private settlement in campus antisemitism cases.\n\nThe plaintiffs – a UCLA undergraduate student, two UCLA School of Law students and a UCLA School of Medicine professor – brought the case in June of 2024, in the wake of UCLA’s facilitation of encampments that were run as exclusionary zones that blocked Jews from attending classes, using the library and accessing other essential areas of campus. UCLA’s misconduct was documented in a report filed by UCLA’s own Task Force to Combat Antisemitism and Anti-Israeli Bias, which found that the university had fostered an antisemitic environment.\n\nThe plaintiffs brought claims in the United States District Court for the Central District of California against the Regents of the University of California as well as several UCLA administrators for, among other things, violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, violation of their free speech rights, violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment, violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and violation of the Ku Klux Klan Act. They promptly sought and obtained sweeping preliminary injunctive relief from Judge Scarsi requiring UCLA to halt all exclusion of Jews from the UCLA campus, UCLA’s campus programs and UCLA’s campus activities. The settlement will officially bring the lawsuit to a close, making Judge Scarsi’s earlier injunction permanent and requiring UCLA to pay a total of $6.13 million.\n\nDavis Polk represented the plaintiffs as pro bono counsel, alongside the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and Clement & Murphy PLLC.\n\nThe Davis Polk team included partner Elliot Moskowitz, counsel Marc J. Tobak and associates Adam M. Greene, Leigh M. Terry Brinkerhoff and Emily Shire. Members of the Davis Polk team are based in the New York and Washington, DC offices.",

The ruling confirms that share options granted to a director by Vermilion were not employment-related securities because they were not issued by reason of his employment.\n\n“On the face of it, Vermilion is concerned with a simple point of statutory construction. The underlying fact pattern is not particularly complex and the words of the statute are, at first glance, clear. And yet it required a decision of the Supreme Court to rule on the application of section 471 to [a director’s] acquisition of a securities option,” Freddie explained.\n\nHe added that the judgment sets out a clear methodology for how to apply the deeming provision, which provides that a right or opportunity to acquire a securities option made available by a person’s employer are to be regarded as available by reason of the employment of that person. “Parliament’s intention behind inserting the deeming provision was to make it clear that if an employer makes available an opportunity to acquire securities or a securities option, those securities or option should be employment-related (thus side-stepping the thorny issue of what was the cause of the opportunity being made available),” Freddie explained.\n\n“HMRC v Vermilion Holdings Ltd,” Tax Journal (October 31, 2023) (subscription required)",

BitGo asserted claims against Galaxy for wrongful repudiation, breach of contract, and breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and sought damages of at least $100 million. Vice Chancellor J. Travis Laster of the Delaware Court of Chancery granted Davis Polk’s motion to dismiss in a bench ruling after oral argument.\n\nIn granting Galaxy’s motion to dismiss, Vice Chancellor Laster adopted Davis Polk’s argument that Galaxy was entitled to terminate the parties’ merger agreement because BitGo failed to deliver contractually compliant financial statements by applicable deadlines in April and July 2022, which triggered Galaxy’s contractual right to terminate the agreement in the first half of August 2022. The court agreed that BitGo’s financial statements failed to satisfy specific requirements set forth in the merger agreement, finding that (1) financial statements that BitGo delivered in April 2022 failed to apply SEC staff interpretive guidance concerning the accounting treatment for digital assets held in custody on behalf of customers, which companies like BitGo are required to follow; and (2) revised financial statements that BitGo subsequently delivered in July 2022 contained a restriction on use from BitGo’s auditors that precluded Galaxy from filing the financial statements with the SEC as part of a registration statement required by the merger agreement. Vice Chancellor Laster also ruled that Galaxy’s valid termination right precluded BitGo’s claims of breach of express and implied terms of the merger agreement.\n\nThe Davis Polk litigation team also included counsel Pascale Bibi and associates Kyra Macy Kaufman, Phoebe Roque and Lily Zhou. Partners Joe Hall, Evan Rosen and Dan Gibbons provided corporate advice.\n\n“Litigator of the Week Runners-Up and Shout Outs,” AmLaw Litigation Daily, (June 16, 2023) (subscription required)",

Now there is more, but the problem with switching focus from a growth story to a profit story is it takes time for issuers to be able to prove their progress,” she said.\n\n“Market downturn sparks longest US tech IPO drought in over 20 years,” Financial Times (September 18, 2022) (subscription required)",

Discussing the SEC’s 35 regulatory proposals in 2022, Joe said, “We’re unlikely to witness a similar pace of rulemaking from the SEC. A lot of effort has been put into formulating proposals over the past 12 months, and an equal amount of effort will need to be invested into adopting them. The focus this year is probably going to be on consolidating the measures that were launched, as opposed to birthing new ones at the same rate as in the past quarter.”\n\n“There has been an enormous push from the SEC to put regulatory proposals on the table, and for the most part, we have not begun to see their adoption yet,” Joe continued. “At this point, we are in latency mode. The betting is that they will ultimately be adopted on a three-to-two vote, with chairman Gary Gensler and the two Democratic SEC commissioners voting in favour and the two Republican commissioners voting against, unless there are significant changes to the proposals.”\n\n“Other elements that corporates and capital market participants are anticipating are the finalisation of stock buyback rules, as well as disclosure rules on both climate change and cybersecurity – both of which are heavily focused onboard processes around managing company exposures,” said Joe.\n\nDiscussing enforcement under Gensler, Joe said, “The SEC will, as it always does, pursue its enforcement program, and will continue to make a point of trying to show that it is aggressively enforcing securities laws against all sorts of capital markets participants. This will go on regardless of any changes that the regulator is able to implement through amending specific rules.”\n\n“US capital markets: 2023, the year of rule adoption,” International Financial Law Review (January 12, 2023) (subscription required)",

Corey noted that the court provided a broad interpretation of Section 7701(o) in saying that the doctrine can be applied to any transaction that does not otherwise meet the statute’s two-prong test.\n\n“That’s an extreme broadening of what everyone had thought of as parameters of the economic substance doctrine,” Corey explained. “That would rightly be a concern for taxpayers who, prior to now, thought they knew what the universe of transactions was to which the economic substance doctrine could apply.”\n\n“Federal Tax Cases To Watch In 2024,” Law360 (January 1, 2024) (subscription required)",

The City of New York.\n\nFor this matter, NYLAG and Davis Polk worked together to bring a class action suit against the City of New York’s Administration for Children Services (ACS) on behalf of a putative class of parents with actual or perceived intellectual and/or developmental disabilities, who have been or will be investigated by ACS. The suit alleged that ACS discriminated against those parents and failed to provide them with reasonable services or accommodations as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act. After nearly six years of litigation – which involved the review of over 100,000 pages in discovery and five depositions of ACS employees – we successfully negotiated a settlement agreement, which received preliminary approval on September 22, 2023. The settlement includes a number of mechanisms designed to improve outcomes for parents with intellectual and/or developmental disabilities who are involved with the child welfare system, including training, specialized protocols for handling of cases involving parents with actual or perceived disabilities, improved oversight, involvement of ACS specialists and an individual relief process.\n\nReflecting on this case, Chief Pro Bono Counsel Amelia Starr said, “We are honored to be recognized by NYLAG for our representation of parents with intellectual and developmental disabilities. After years of work with NYLAG and negotiations with the City, we have reached a settlement that we hope will bring about positive, demonstrable change for families in their interactions with ACS – both for parents with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their children.”\n\nThe Davis Polk team included Chief Pro Bono counsel Amelia Starr, senior counsel Sharon Katz, counsel Jim Windels and Head of Pro Bono Litigation Dara Sheinfeld, associates Stephanie Hansen, Jonathan Huberman, Michael Kucharski, Tess Liegeois, Meredith Manning and Charlotte Savino, and former associates Adrienne Adkins, Iris Hsiao, Brooke Kettler, Clara Kim, Alexa Lutchen, Cindy McNair, Benjamin Wasserman, Katie Trionfetti Wolfgang and Brett Workman.\n\nLearn more about Davis Polk’s Pro Bono program.",

Commenting on the results, Davis Polk partner and Finance practice head Jason Kyrwood said, “We have a really comprehensive platform. If there’s a transaction out there that could pivot between direct lending and syndicated, or may have a whole business securitization or infrastructure-related component, we can do all of that with excellence and at scale.” The practice also handles back leverage, preferred equity, other types of hybrid capital and cross-border work.\n\nDiscussing how the year started, Jason noted, “The first quarter was helped by the fact that there was a lot of overhang from last year. We had this real burst of activity right around the election. As soon as the election was over…we started getting calls on new deals.”\n\nAdditionally, Jason mentioned that he is cautiously optimistic that the long-awaited buyout cycle may materialize soon, “I’ve been saying for a while now – and I’m far from the only one – that there is a tsunami of LBO activity coming, I just don’t know when. I’m starting to see some signs that make me feel optimistic that there may be more LBO activity in the second half, but the uncertainties that we are all living with right now make it hard to have conviction around that timeline.”\n\nHighlights of Davis Polk’s H1 2025 league table rankings include:\n\nLSEG LPC\n\nBloomberg\n\nDebtwire\n\nKBRA Direct Lending Deals",

So that makes it attractive,” Dan explained. “The other thing is that commercial real estate tends to be pretty stable. If your money is parked in a commercial real estate project, you probably are not going to lose all your money.”\n\nDan also noted that the “practical effect of this is that banks will be even more on the lookout for potentially suspicious transactions involving commercial real estate, and that would mean some form of enhanced due diligence.”\n\n“FinCEN Takes Aim At Commercial Property Amid Ukraine War,“ Law360 (January 27, 2023) (subscription required)",

These aspects of the office’s guidance will be important for understanding “what can be patented, and where they’re going to draw the line,” said David. “The question is, where and how can AI be used in the inventive process without rendering the final product completely unpatentable?” he said.\n\nDavid also noted that while the office’s guidance on patent eligibility may be limited to such “clear cases,” it could go further and address questions like when the use of AI improves on an existing process in such a way that it becomes a patent-eligible invention.\n\n“I tend to think they won’t get into those details and rather take it on case by case,” he said. “But that’s something to look for.”\n\n“What Attys Expect From USPTO Guidance On AI And Patents,” Law360 (November 7, 2023) (subscription required)",

The Legal Aid Society served as co-counsel, and the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office joined in the defense’s resentencing application.\n\n“Our goal is to really understand the case, be encyclopedias on it, and to then present it to them,” Denis explained. He noted that the day Jackie was released from prison was one of the greatest days of his life.\n\nDara added that the amount of work it took to get up to speed on Jackie’s case, where multiple defendants were involved, made it stand out. But in the end, her case was “simple” and “obvious.”\n\nDara previously practiced as a litigation associate at Davis Polk and ran Sanctuary for Families’ walk-in law centers for domestic abuse victims in the Bronx and Manhattan. She said that it’s been remarkable for her to go from representing domestic violence victims to representing criminal defendants on sentencing issues. “I think it’s just so important to realize when we’re working with our clients…who are just complaining witnesses in criminal cases, who are in abusive relationships, those exact clients could be our next DVSJA clients,” she said. “I used to see this as very different work, and in the last few years it’s been really clear that there’s a lot of crossover.”\n\nThe article highlights that the Davis Polk team representing Jackie also included associates Stephanie Hansen, Jaclyn Katz, Jessica Paduganan, and legal assistants Angelica Matoske and Kristina Milberger.\n\n“Davis Polk and Legal Aid Society Team to Knock 15 Years Off Sex-Trafficking Survivor’s Sentence,” AmLaw Litigation Daily (September 25, 2024) (subscription required)",

Medical technology and diagnostics firms that have begun to generate recurring revenue are in the queue as well.\n\nWhen asked whether the upcoming election might affect IPO activity and cause some companies to accelerate their plans to go public, Alan said, “Either way, whether it’s Biden or Trump, that isn’t really going to have an impact on the market’s ability to do an IPO.”\n\nIn Q1 2024, Davis Polk was again a leading advisor on IPOs, taking part in five IPOs that raised $2.7 billion. This includes the IPOs of Reddit and Auna, two of the three largest IPOs from March.",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner and Restructuring practice co-head Damian Schaible and partner Brian Resnick were quoted in Petition on the biggest bankruptcy themes of 2022 and the outlook for 2023.\n\nRegarding major trends from the year, Damian pointed to liability management and lenders vs. lenders. “It was inevitable with increasingly loose documents, tremendous amounts of money flowing into credit managers and a higher interest rate environment, but sponsors are now increasingly looking to lever documents and creditors to provide liquidity, discount capture and maturity extensions, and creditors are increasingly willing to play ball. In 2022, we saw an explosion in threatened and executed non-pro rata deals, and the few recent challenges surviving motions to dismiss have done little to tamper the environment.”\n\nBrian also mentioned “increasingly creative liability management exercises, broadening of companies taking advantage of these opportunities, resulting effect of creditor groups organizing early and often (and sometimes signing cooperation agreements), debt trading prices reflecting assumptions about anticipated liability management and some interesting judicial decisions on uptierings” as themes from 2022.\n\n\n\nAsked specifically about their predictions for the biggest restructuring theme of 2023, Brian noted that private credit/direct lending funds will play “a more direct role in the traditional restructuring space, either using their dry powder to refinance distressed businesses, or going through more significant workouts of their own existing loans.”\n\nDamian added that he expects to see more “bootstrap A&Es” as supply chain and demand issues continue. “2024 and 2025 maturities will become a real focus for sponsors and public companies. Staring at maturities that are not refinanceable in the regular way used to prompt companies to consider deleveraging restructurings, but now they much more frequently look to utilize weak documents to offer carrots and sticks to incentivize existing creditors to extend maturities,” Damian explained.\n\n“BK Pros Weigh In,” Petition (December 21, 2022)",

So, you don’t see it that often, although it does happen.”\n\n“Finra Dings Fidelity Over Thieving Stock-Plan Employee,” Ignites (January 10, 2025) (subscription required)",

The challenges will vary by company, but at minimum it will mean companies and boards need to be on top of emerging expectations and proposed rulemaking, rather than wait until that becomes a mandate.”\n\nShe also encouraged boards to find the right tone in promoting transparency, accountability, and stakeholder engagement with respect to their company’s ESG disclosures and sustainability reporting. “It’s a bit of a cliche at this point, but tone at the top matters,” she said. “If boards believe that ESG disclosure objectives are important, then they should encourage and support management in these efforts. This includes not only showing clear indications of interest, staying informed, and asking questions, but also an element that isn’t talked about as much but just as crucial, which is to recognize and appreciate the complexity involved.”\n\n“Tone at the Top Matters: Corporate Governance Attorney Ning Chiu on Board Directors’ Crucial Role in SEC Reporting,” Corporate Directors Forum (May 30, 2023)",

Meta and WhatsApp identified NSO Group as the source of the attack, and determined that NSO‘s victims included journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents and others.\n\nThe jury trial, which was to decide the amount of damages that NSO Group owed Meta and WhatsApp, began on April 28, 2025 in Oakland, California. The six-day trial included groundbreaking testimony from NSO Group executives, who admitted that they used WhatsApp to install spyware on the mobile devices of up to tens of thousands of individuals, and continued to use WhatsApp to install spyware even after WhatsApp and Meta filed their complaint. The jury awarded Meta and WhatsApp the full cost of their employees’ response to the May 2019 attacks. The jury also found that NSO Group acted with malice, oppression, or fraud in violating the CDAFA, and awarded over $167 million in punitive damages.\n\nIn a Q&A with AmLaw, Greg explained what was at stake in the case. “We represented the plaintiffs WhatsApp and Meta in this litigation. At stake was their ability to protect the privacy of WhatsApp users’ communications in the first instance, and to prevent malicious actors from targeting their platform and their users. Privacy is at the core of WhatsApp’s mission and is the reason that WhatsApp provides industry-leading encryption. This case was about holding NSO accountable and sending a message to NSO and others in their industry that the consequences for those who target U.S. companies for these unlawful purposes will be severe, and that WhatsApp’s world-class infrastructure is meant for connecting friends and families and is off-limits for spyware makers and other bad actors.”\n\nNotably, there were a number of challenges that came up around the production of the Pegasus source code in the litigation. Tony told AmLaw, “Getting robust discovery from a foreign spyware company whose entire business is cloaked in secrecy and relies on the active concealment of its work was among the most challenging aspects of this case. Although NSO failed to produce certain discovery (including the code for its Pegasus spyware) in violation of the court’s orders and was sanctioned as a result, we were ultimately successful in that effort, obtaining sufficient discovery for the court to conclude as a matter of law that NSO was liable on all claims and for the jury to recognize NSO’s conduct as malicious, oppressive and fraudulent.”\n\nThe case marks the first jury verdict against a commercial spyware company in U.S. court, and is the first U.S. verdict against NSO Group, which was added to the Department of Commerce Entity List for activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States in November 2021.  The case is also the largest ever reported verdict in a civil case brought under either the CFAA or the CDAFA.\n\nWhen asked what he would remember most about working on the case, Micah said, “I’ll most remember how this case rewarded patience, focus and persistence. We faced down myriad procedural obstacles and discovery barriers to get this case to trial and hold NSO accountable. Credit for that goes first to the patient and courageous team at WhatsApp and Meta who led overall strategy and trusted us with this assignment, and next to the steadfast and extremely effective team at Davis Polk—especially the counsel and associates who lived and breathed this case for years.”\n\nMany Davis Polk attorneys and staff played key roles throughout the case, including counsel Gina Cora, Craig T. Cagney and Andrew Yaphe, associates Esther C. Townes, Luca Marzorati, Muhammad Sardar, Gersham Johnson, Quentin J. Ullrich, Amelia Birnie, Kaitlin Campanini, Meenu Mathews and Cyerra Haywood, law clerks Tyler Conroy and Thomas Floyd and senior paralegal Felicia Yu.\n\n“Litigators of the Week: Spyware-Maker NSO Group Hit With $168M Verdict for Hacking WhatsApp,” AmLaw Litigation Daily (May 9, 2025)",

If they start to go to the real core parts of the BSA [Bank Secrecy Act] … you could eviscerate the BSA. The U.S. would become the focal point for financial crime for the whole world.”\n\n“Hollywood Reporter’s Notebook,” MoneyLaundering.com (May 2, 2025) (subscription required)",

According to the article, more than 60 companies have filed for bankruptcy for a second or third time over the past two years.\n\n“For an industry like retail where there’s a secular challenge, it’s not surprising that even using all of the tools of bankruptcy, you could have an outcome where the turnaround doesn’t work out,” Adam said.\n\nSpeaking about companies that strike out-of-court agreements with lenders to slash debt without ceding control of the business, as happens in bankruptcy, Adam noted, “In some respects, that’s the functional equivalent of a repeat bankruptcy.”\n\n“Repeat Corporate Bankruptcies in US Hit Fastest Pace Since 2020,” Bloomberg (January 14, 2025) (subscription required)",

Our team was instrumental in the development of a child support pilot program that expands a video-conferencing platform created by Legal Information for Families Today to bring child support legal consultations to litigants throughout the state. The pilot aims to help the growing number of unrepresented New Yorkers litigating child support petitions in the wake of the pandemic. The Davis Polk team was led by Head of Pro Bono Litigation Dara Sheinfeld and associates Alexa Lutchen and Elizabeth Weinstein.\n\nThe team was honored at a ceremony on October 26, 2021, in celebration of National Pro Bono week.\n\nLearn more about Davis Polk’s Pro Bono program.",

It’s a whole new thing, which needs a regulatory perimeter and needs supervision, and by not doing anything, I don’t think we’ll make it go away.”\n\n“It’s a kind of a triple whammy,” she continued. “You’ve got to have bipartisan consensus, you’ve got to come out with the right kind of policy, and you’ve got a lot of regulatory turf battles.”\n\nMargaret noted that the major crypto firms lobby for, and have had a wide influence on, overall digital assets regulations and policy proposals. “And so that’s why I think a targeted stablecoin regulation is more likely,” she said.\n\n“What’s in store for 2023?

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Chris Healey was featured in a Q&A by Fund Board Views discussing the growing trend of opening private investment opportunities to retail investors.\n\nWhen asked why there is a push now to give retail investors easier and more access to private markets, Chris listed three reasons: “1. Companies are staying private for longer (if they go public at all), and investors often interact with or hear about certain private companies in their daily lives and wonder how they can invest in them. 2. The growth of defined contribution plans/401(k)s, where there are few—if any—options to invest in private markets, means fewer investors have exposure to private markets investments through their retirement accounts. 3. Investment managers focused on private markets investments are looking to continue to grow by raising money from new pools of capital and previously had not made their funds available to… individuals who write smaller checks.”\n\nChris also noted that there are a variety of considerations to keep in mind for various private funds. He said, “While many private markets strategies have overlapping considerations for boards (e.g., valuation challenges), there are some different considerations for private credit, private equity, and secondaries strategies. For example, … Private equity and secondaries strategies may present specific liquidity challenges for funds that seek to offer retail investors periodic liquidity. It is important for a board to understand the challenges that can arise during the lifecycle of individual investments.”\n\nDiscussing the balance of investor access and liquidity needs in retail-friendly structures, Chris said, “Setting aside any SEC or Congressional actions that could expand investor access to private markets, there are some things that the industry could do to make it easier for investors to invest in these types of regulated funds. Some types, particularly interval funds that strike a daily NAV, are available for daily “point and click” subscriptions, while others (especially BDCs) require more cumbersome subscription documents and monthly or quarterly subscriptions. … In terms of liquidity, while individual funds from time to time may face a liquidity crunch, the most common liquidity program in private markets fund products to date has been a share repurchase program where the fund offers to buy back up to 5% of outstanding shares each quarter; that seems to have been sufficient in most circumstances for investors and intermediaries to be comfortable.”\n\n“Q&A: Opening the private markets door to retail investors,” Fund Board Views (July 11, 2025) (subscription required)",

But for more complex structures, direct lenders are often better suited.”\n\n“It gets harder when you have to untangle businesses and don’t have historical financials for syndication and ratings,” he said. “Then the direct market is often an easier place to start and, at the right time, you can re-syndicate to the syndicated market.”\n\nLooking forward, the EY Parthenon report projects flat corporate M&A volumes for 2025 and private equity deal volume growth of roughly 1%.\n\n“I think there’s a certain baseline level of activity that will keep us active, but the tsunami of deals we were bracing for has not materialized, and it is anyone’s guess at this point when that will change, though we are confident it will,” Jason said.\n\n“Carve-Outs Gain Stream as Tariffs and Rates Curb Sponsor-Backed M&A Momentum,” Octus (June 13, 2025)",

The annual event honors members of the legal community who have gone “above and beyond” by providing outstanding pro bono representation and advocacy to victims of domestic violence, sex trafficking and related forms of gender violence.\n\nThe Davis Polk team was recognized for their work on behalf of a client who left China for the United States in search of employment to enable her to earn money to win back custody of her children, who remained in China. Subjected to trafficking once she arrived in the U.S., she was referred to Sanctuary’s Queens Human Trafficking Intervention Pro Bono Project. Working with Sanctuary, former associate Lisa Doolittle and associate Hanbing Zhang worked hard to build the client’s trust, file a successful T-visa application and support her during the successful prosecution of her trafficker. Partner Po Sit and associate Iris Hsiao are currently helping to reunite her with her children. Special Counsel for Pro Bono Sharon Katz supervised the matter.\n\nSanctuary for Families is New York’s leading service provider and advocate for survivors of domestic violence, sex trafficking and related forms of gender violence. Each year, Sanctuary empowers thousands of adults and children to move from fear and abuse to safety and stability, transforming lives through a comprehensive range of services.\n\nRead more about Davis Polk’s important work on Sanctuary’s blog.",

Joe noted that external and internal political pressure could force a proposal to include some form of Scope 3 disclosures. “It’ll be very difficult, frankly, for Chairman Gensler to come out with a proposal that does not come out with some form of Scope 3 disclosure. However, if the disclosure is just completely unmoored by traditional notions of materiality … I think there will be massive pushback on that,” he said.\n\nJoe discussed that the SEC will likely focus on disclosures that are material to investors because that is what they have authority to regulate. He said, “The risk for them is they get a rule at the SEC and then the courts just throw the entire thing out. Everybody has an interest in a rule that is tailored to the SEC’s actual authority, which would presume that it has a materiality qualifier to it.”\n\n“SEC’s ESG Proposal Unlikely to Require Vendor Data,” Ignites (March 18, 2022) (subscription required)",

In the Q&A, Leor shares his thoughts on market activity over the last year as well as what to expect in the year ahead.\n\n“In the first five months of [2023], activity levels were lower, the pace of deals was slower and the likelihood of deals going bust was higher. By May or so, we began to see the trend reverse as pricing stabilized. In the earlier part of the year, we were working on deals that featured price deferrals and preferred equity – deals were getting complicated to try and close that valuation gap. As pricing has tightened up, you don’t have to do that as much,” Leor explained.\n\nWhen asked what he thinks will be the biggest challenges facing the secondaries market in 2024, Leor said, “It’s likely we’ll see more regulatory enforcement activity around continuation vehicles. Clearly if [the Securities and Exchange Commission] is on exam and they see there is a CV, they dig in and they have made it clear through their rule making what they see as the pluses and minuses of the market.”\n\n“Secondary Investors Bank on Pricing Gaps Closing This Year,” Wall Street Journal (January 12, 2024) (subscription required)",

    "text": "On July 9, 2024, the Second Circuit issued a summary order solidifying victory for our client in a case brought against her under the Hague Convention by the father of her children. The panel affirmed the June 2023 decision by Judge Oetken of the Southern District of New York to deny the father’s petition for the return of their two children to Spain. Our client fled Spain with the children in 2021 to escape their father’s domestic abuse and out of concern about his connections to organized crime and drug trafficking. Since arriving in New York, she has worked tirelessly to support her children.\n\nThe Davis Polk team prepared a 69-page appellate brief and on April 2, 2024, White Collar associate Brendan Blase delivered the oral argument before the Second Circuit. The Second Circuit upheld the District Court’s finding that our client successfully asserted two defenses to repatriation – the well-settled and mature child objection defenses – and held that the District Court appropriately exercised its discretion in declining to return the children to Spain. The Second Circuit’s decision not only changes the lives of a deserving family, but it serves as an important precedent for future survivors of abuse seeking refuge. The District Court expressly credited our client’s allegations of domestic violence, which is critical for any future custody proceedings and for our client, who was finally heard and believed.\n\nSanctuary for Families originally referred our client to Davis Polk given the firm’s significant experience litigating Hague matters on behalf of survivors of domestic violence.\n\nThe Davis Polk appeals team included Chief Pro Bono Counsel Amelia Starr, counsel and Head of Pro Bono Litigation Dara Sheinfeld, associates Brendan Blase, Meredith Manning and Ryann Moelis.",

Ultimately, Eli predicts that the trend of bankruptcy-related creditor disputes will continue to grow.\n\n“Creditor Disputes in Bankruptcy,” Corporate Disputes (Oct-Dec 2023 issue)",

    "text": "On March 23, 2023, in collaboration with the Promise of Justice Initiative (PJI), Davis Polk secured the immediate release of our pro bono client who was incarcerated in Louisiana for more than 29 years following his conviction by a non-unanimous jury. We became involved in this case in December 2022 and supported our client’s application for post-conviction relief by advocating with the Orleans Parish District Attorney’s office and providing new information to the court highlighting the 1995 trial’s many flaws. These efforts resulted in the approval of a plea agreement by the Orleans Parish Criminal District Court.\n\nIn our client’s 1995 trial, at 21 years old, the non-unanimous jury convicted him of second-degree murder and he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Independent of the non-unanimous jury verdict, there were a number of egregious issues with the trial including: the fact that one of the prosecution’s key eyewitnesses (the victim’s sister) had since recanted her trial testimony in full; the complete absence of any physical or forensic evidence otherwise connecting our client to the crime; a potential Brady violation by the state; and the fact that defense counsel failed to present an alibi to the jury despite our client’s continued insistence that he was not at the crime scene. During re-sentencing, the Court remarked that the full recantation of the key witness’ testimony “took [his] breath away.” These faults of our client’s trial along with his stellar record of success while incarcerated convinced the District Attorney’s office and the Court that his immediate release was warranted.\n\nThe Davis Polk team included senior counsel Denis McInerney, Head of Pro Bono Litigation Dara Sheinfeld, Pro Bono Counsel for Racial Justice Initiatives Diane Lucas, associates Benjamin Guillon, Emma Himes and Ian Hogg, law clerk Julia Leff and structured products senior analyst Jack Hannah.",

The article noted that four partners – Mark Knight, Jifree Cader, Luke McDougall and Gordon Milne – have been announced to join the London office over the past six months, bringing the total lawyer count to over 60 while establishing a new practice area and bolstering expertise in others.\n\nDavis Polk Chair and Managing Partner Neil Barr said, “We realized that our London platform wasn’t scaled to deliver the full spectrum of services we wanted for our clients, which prompted us to rethink our approach.”\n\nWill Pearce, Davis Polk partner and Europe practice head, noted, “With the increased importance of private capital for transactions, and in step with developments in New York, it became clear there was a real client-driven opportunity to strengthen our finance capability and add UK and European-focused private equity to our M&A practice.”\n\nHe described it as a “natural evolution of what we’ve achieved in London over the last ten years or so.”\n\nDiscussing Mark and Jifree’s arrivals to the firm, Neil said that their hires were “a natural next step” in kickstarting the firm’s European restructuring practice.\n\nIn addition to Luke, who joined the firm’s London Finance team in May, Aaron Ferner was promoted to partner in July. Neil said, “This expanded team brings greater depth and scale, enhancing our ability to service matters that are not only U.S.-based but also sourced out of the UK.”\n\nLuke noted that part of the appeal in joining Davis Polk was the unique opportunity to join at a critical juncture in the development of its London operations, bringing with him a robust reputation and extensive experience in UK and cross-border leveraged finance, corporate finance, and restructuring.\n\nGordon, who is leading the growth of Davis Polk’s private equity practice in London, noted, “U.S. PE firms are increasingly seeing potential value in European assets, and we see clear opportunities in our ability to advise our U.S. clients on current European market practice. Furthermore, European PE clients and their portfolio companies are increasingly looking to acquire assets in the U.S. or tap the greater pools of capital in the U.S.”\n\n“London remains a global hub,” he continued. “It is fundamental to have top-tier legal expertise in London.”\n\nDiscussing Luke and Gordon’s arrivals, Will said, “In Luke and Gordon, respectively, we found a visible, well-connected leveraged finance partner with a track record of business growth, and a seasoned private equity partner with longstanding European relationships.”\n\nNeil added, “We recognized them as lawyers with established client followings, who were highly likely to bring those relationships to Davis Polk, and that has indeed proven to be the case.”\n\nThe article also noted a number of U.S. hires in 2024, including partners Andrew Ahern, Alisa Waxman, Luke Eldridge, Elena Millerman, Nick Caro and Chris Healey.\n\n“‘With an open checkbook, they’ll likely target top talent’ – Davis Polk turns heads with London scale-up,” Legal Business (November 25, 2024)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Robert Cohen was quoted in Law360 discussing how crypto enforcement could shift in 2025.\n\nThe article noted that over the past few years, the SEC has gone from bringing enforcement actions against token issuers to targeting the intermediaries where these assets are bought and sold. Robert said, “We’ll see whether in the new administration there’s a return to the focus on core fundraising activities and how they decide to approach the intermediaries.”\n\n“A significant development in 2025 would be if we start to see appellate court decisions on some of these issues that will provide precedents the district courts within that circuit would have to follow,” he continued.\n\nDiscussing potential appellate decisions, Robert explained that the Second Circuit could deliver an opinion that provides more clarity on whether and how securities laws apply to secondary trading of digital assets, but that depends on how broad of an approach the appeals court takes, since the Ripple case itself concerns only the trading of the XRP token and doesn’t require a court to weigh in on the role of intermediaries.\n\nNoting the possibilities, Robert asked, “Does it rule very specifically on the facts of the case, which would be informative but not necessarily all that definitive in how future judges would view different facts? Or would the decision address the issues more broadly, such that you would have a better idea of how courts are going to be required to come out on these issues?”\n\nRobert also mentioned that while the Second Circuit is an important appellate court, it’s not the only one in crypto.\n\n“In particular, we’ve seen an increasing amount of litigation outside of the Second Circuit, in particular in the Fifth Circuit, that probably will continue,” Robert said. “So, a Second Circuit decision would be informative, but we would need to see how other circuits approach the issues also.”\n\nHighlighting that the SEC’s crypto priorities could trend towards rulemaking rather than litigation, Robert said that if new rules are proposed and adopted, that could provide an opportunity for crypto defendants to show how unclear the landscape was when their alleged violations occurred. But he noted, “Whether that would have a direct impact on specific litigations is probably less clear.”\n\n“‘Profound Shift’ Forecast For Crypto Enforcement In 2025,” Law360 (January 1, 2025) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner and Restructuring practice co-head Marshall Huebner and Civil Litigation partner Ben Kaminetzky were highlighted in AmLaw Litigation Daily’s end-of-year round up for their landmark win for Purdue’s stakeholders. On May 30, 2023, a Davis Polk team led by Marshall and Ben successfully convinced the Second Circuit to overturn a district court ruling finding the bankruptcy code didn’t authorize liability releases for the Sackler family. The Second Circuit exhaustively reviewed the law and set forth a new seven-factor test for evaluating third-party releases.\n\nPurdue is one of the largest and most complex mass tort cases in U.S. history – and with the largest claims pool of any bankruptcy in U.S. history.\n\n“Encore!

    "text": "A Davis Polk team led by partners Ted Polubinski and Mari Grace and counsel Jonathan Chang received a shout-out in AmLaw Litigation Daily’s “Litigator of the Week” column for securing dismissal of a securities class action filed against Tuya and other defendants in the Southern District of New York.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed as a putative class action in 2022, alleged that Tuya’s IPO registration statement was materially misleading because it did not disclose that certain of Tuya’s third-party customers were then engaged in a scheme to generate fake reviews on Amazon. The plaintiffs claimed those customers were later banned from selling on Amazon, which harmed Tuya’s business.\n\nLast year, Judge John P. Cronan denied Tuya’s motion to dismiss, sending the case toward discovery. The Davis Polk team, however, instead moved promptly for judgment on the pleadings, focusing on issues that the court had declined to consider on the original motion. This effected a stay of discovery in the case.\n\nAfter a lengthy oral argument, Judge Cronan granted the motion in full, dismissing the case in its entirety.\n\nThe Davis Polk litigation team also included counsel Yuan Zheng and associates Marie Killmond, James C. Butler and Henry Hawkins\n\n“Litigator of the Week Runners-Up and Shout-Outs,” AmLaw Litigation Daily (March 14, 2025) (subscription required)",

Blanco noted that the IPO pipeline looks strong for the remainder of the first quarter and even into the second quarter. He also explained that companies are exploring numerous routes to going public and that the market is showing little signs of slowing any time soon. The article mentions that Davis Polk advised on over two dozen IPOs in January for both blank-check and operating companies and led at least 26 offerings for issuers and underwriters.\n\n“SPACs Surged in January Following Record-Breaking 2020,” Law360 (February 2, 2021) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner and European antitrust practice head Jürgen Schindler discussed the recent growth of the firm’s Antitrust & Competition practice in Europe with The Lawyer.\n\nJürgen noted that it is imperative in today’s world for any firm aiming to be seen as elite for antitrust regulatory advice to have capabilities in Washington DC, New York, London and Brussels. “There is such an increase in regulation around the world, more than 140 jurisdictions just for merger control, plus there is also a rapid growth of FDI,” he explained. “Antitrust and FDI are becoming a threshold matter for transactions to get through. It used to be the case that regulatory advice was a bit of an afterthought. Now it’s key and must be frontloaded.”\n\nThe Lawyer highlighted Matt Yeowart’s promotion this week to partner within the firm’s Antitrust & Competition practice to further build out the team. Matt works across London and Brussels, with extensive experience advising on complex, high-profile global, U.K. and EU merger control and foreign direct investment reviews, as well as conduct issues and enforcement matters.\n\nIn addition, the firm recently welcomed counsel Charles Pommiès in the Brussels office. Charles focuses on antitrust investigations, merger control reviews and foreign investment reviews in connection with a broad variety of matters for leading U.S., European and Asian companies across industries.\n\nDavis Polk launched its European antitrust practice in Brussels in 2023 with the hiring of Jürgen and EU Antitrust special advisor Frances Dethmers, marking a major step in the firm’s global expansion and broadening its capabilities to advise clients on sophisticated antitrust matters under EU law. Davis Polk is recognized as a preeminent firm in antitrust and competition law, including with top-tier rankings from publications such as Global Competition Review, Benchmark Litigation and Chambers USA.\n\nThe article also discusses Davis Polk’s growth more broadly in London, including through the addition of restructuring partners Jifree Cader and Mark Knight, private equity M&A partner Gordon Milne and finance partner Luke McDougall.\n\n“Davis Polk targets A&O Shearman for antitrust team boost,” The Lawyer (July 2, 2025) (subscription required)",

    "text": "With more than 25 years of experience in export controls and economic sanctions, Davis Polk partner John Reynolds typically advises companies on U.S. trade restrictions. The deep knowledge that John and others at Davis Polk have in this area has also been uniquely valuable to pro bono client Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF or, in English, Doctors Without Borders), which provides lifesaving medical care in trouble spots around the globe. We recently spoke with John, counsel Will Schisa and associate Kendall Howell about the work they have been doing for this group, which received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1999.\n\nMSF is a nonprofit, not a business. Why does the group need sanctions and export controls advice?\n\nJohn: They operate in many places where Americans are not supposed to be present and where American goods and services generally are not supposed to be sent. Sometimes MSF has sought advice on how to get U.S. government approval of a particular activity, such as staying in Syria when it was an active war zone and caregivers’ neutrality was not being respected. In other scenarios, they may have concerns about an activity and we can tell them there is no restriction and they can move forward.\n\nCan you give us an example of a project our team completed for MSF?\n\nWill: In 2019, MSF was looking to send U.S. software and computer equipment to North Korea to support its tuberculosis testing and treatment program. The U.S. allows exports of medicines, medical devices and agricultural products to highly sanctioned jurisdictions. But because the needed equipment did not fall under that authorization, MSF needed to obtain a specific license from the U.S. Commerce Department.\n\nKendall:  My role was to run point, to be the go-between between the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) and MSF. I worked with MSF to draft and submit the application and then to provide supplemental information requested by BIS. I started on this in October 2019, only weeks after I joined Davis Polk, and MSF got the license in January 2020.\n\nAre there issues we have assisted MSF with this year?\n\nWill: In January, at the tail end of the Trump administration, the State Department designated the Houthi group, an armed faction in the civil war in Yemen, as  a foreign terrorist organization. The Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) concurrently issued a general license to enable humanitarian organizations to continue to provide aid in the country. Still, the OFAC license didn’t eliminate all the legal risk for humanitarian groups operating in Yemen, and MSF had concerns. We helped them understand the legal implications, including how the government has historically looked at the issues – counsel that was informed by my previous work at OFAC.\n\nJohn: The concerns went away in February, when the Biden administration reversed the FTO designation.\n\nWill: More recently, MSF came to us with general question about the intersection between U.S. sanctions and export controls in certain countries where MSF conducts activities. We helped them understand OFAC and Commerce Department licensing requirements that may apply to items that support the organization’s work in those countries.\n\nWhat other types of projects has Davis Polk helped the group with?\n\nJohn: Some work has involved three-way conversations with MSF and pharmaceutical companies donating medicines for the group to use. Drug companies often make generous donations, but some companies get nervous when the MSF staffers say they are excited to take those medicines to a sanctioned country. We can talk to a compliance person at the company about any sanctions or export control issues and often will tell them there isn’t an issue they need to be concerned about. We have enough credibility that they will tend to listen to us, even though we aren’t their counsel.\n\nIn other cases, we have helped negotiate a solution in which MSF sets up a system to segregate medicines from a particular company and ensure that those goods go only to a particular destination.\n\nAre there particular aspects you have enjoyed or found meaningful while working with MSF?\n\nWill: The most meaningful part is being able to help an organization that does a lot of worthwhile work.\n\nJohn: MSF’s people are oriented toward solving problems – life-threatening health and humanitarian crises – and they turn to us to help solve legal problems that can get in the way of the critical services they provide.\n\nKendall: I was familiar with MSF’s work from my time in the military, and it has been a real honor to be able to contribute to their mission, beginning in my first year at Davis Polk. As a first-year associate, pro bono work is a really excellent opportunity to learn a great deal, work closely with the client and see the impact you have on the organization.\n\nInterview: Pro bono assistance to Doctors Without Borders | Davis Polk",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Michael Hong was quoted in Private Equity Law Report discussing GP clawbacks.\n\nThe article noted that limited LP liquidity caused by a lack of distributions has created a challenging fundraising environment for GPs to navigate. Michael said that the result has been a “buyers market” that favors LPs in negotiations around fund terms and provisions. Although most might expect that to manifest in reductions in management fees and carried interest, that has not been the case. Instead, most negotiating efforts are expended at the margins of economic terms, such as how claw-backs are calculated and structured, Michael continued. “I would say that clawbacks are being wrapped up into the tapestry of more fundamental material economic issues that are up for grabs in the current buyer’s market,” he added.\n\nDiscussing clawback risk for funds with a European-style waterfall, Michael noted, “Funds with high recycling capabilities are more prone to sequencing risk because recycling means you have more dry powder that you can call over the life of the fund as compared to funds that have more limited recycling capabilities.”\n\nNoting reasons behind the increased focus on these particular clawback provisions, Michael pointed to the rising popularity of private credit funds in the marketplace in recent years. “As credit funds tend to have greater recycling flexibility than their PE fund counterparts, notwithstanding their European-waterfall features, claw-back risks have found their way into the current zeitgeist of negotiations,” he explained.\n\nOn another note, Michael explained that GPs prefer to avoid escrow provisions because they both defer the GP’s receipt of carry distributions and, just as frustratingly, require the cash to sit in the account, earning little compared to the fund’s portfolio. “Often the parties will pre-negotiate for the escrow account to be invested in a prescribed set of low-risk type of instruments,” he said. “There was a time when some GPs had discretionary authority to invest escrow proceeds into deals, but that is pretty rare now.”\n\nObserving that escrow provisions are far less common than GP clawback provisions for managers going to market with new funds, Michael said, “Unless a firm has had an escrow concept baked into its documents since early in their life, it is pretty rare for GPs to offer an escrow option as opposed to a clawback. That said, GPs will sometimes agree to escrow provisions if they are struggling to fundraise – particularly in the current environment – or if LPs were burned by the GP performing poorly in past funds, resulting in a clawback.”\n\nExplaining that individual investment professionals do not sign separate signature pages for guarantee agreements with each LP, Michael noted, “Instead, the guarantee is expressed as a contract for which the LPs are express third-party beneficiaries such that, for all intents and purposes, there is a direct contractual obligation between the employee receiving the carry and the LPs.”\n\nHowever, he pointed out that not all types of fund managers are expected to grant those types of individual guarantees. “Bulge bracket fund managers that are obviously credit-worthy are not expected to grant those rights to investors; instead, it’s typically middle-market firms with around 25 investment professionals who receive a slice of carry distributions.”\n\nAlso, it is highly unlikely that LPs will ever practically need to act upon those individual guarantees, he added. “That would be a ‘hell and damnation’ scenario, as no LP would probably ever invest with that firm again if a clawback devolved to investors suing individual guarantors in court for claw-back obligations,” Michael added. “More often than not, if the GP wants to have any going concern value, then they will negotiate with the LPs to buy themselves some time to eventually repay the money themselves.”\n\n“GP Clawbacks and Related Risk Mitigation Tactics LPs Pursue to Prevent Overpayment of Carried Interest (Part One of Two),” Private Equity Law Report (April 3, 2025) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner and Restructuring practice co-head Marshall Huebner discussed his work as lead counsel to Spirit Airlines on its chapter 11 restructuring with Law.com.\n\nSpirit Airlines emerged from chapter 11 just four months after filing, which is unprecedented. “We had to get court and creditor approval for a full plan and disclosure statement, which often takes at least a year – no one’s ever done it faster than we have,” Marshall said. “That’s what made this case so different.”\n\nMarshall noted that his experience leading the successful chapter 11 filings of other airlines, including Delta, Frontier and Aeroméxico proved to be essential in this case. “I’ve done a very material amount of airline work for both carriers and their creditors over the last quarter of a century. Having an extremely deep understanding of the industry and what will work and what won’t is part of what sets us apart,” he explained.\n\nMarshall added that the secret to resolving extremely complex matters like this is to do an incredible amount of careful listening before speaking and designing. “Figuring out what was going to work best for this situation, with its multiple constituencies, including large groups of both secured and unsecured noteholders, was critical, and we laid the groundwork for the restructuring long before we ever filed,” he noted. “To take a multi-billion dollar company from the petition date to a confirmation hearing in 87 days, including having to solicit public securities holders, is simply without precedent.”\n\nWhen asked what his proudest moment in this case was, Marshall noted that there were two highlights. “First, bankruptcies have gotten extraordinarily expensive. Getting this done in under 90 days saved Spirit well over $100 million and a lot of risk, and positions it well for future success,” Marshall said. “We were unrelenting in our focus on speed and efficiency. Second, the US Trustee and the SEC both objected to our form of plan releases. We knew they were wrong on both the facts and the law. The Court’s 47-page opinion entirely in our favor, following almost four hours of intense oral argument, made important law and was a complete vindication. Sometimes, even we can’t settle. Then we litigate – and win.”\n\n“Spirit Springs From Bankruptcy: Firm Guides Rapid Airline Restructuring,” Law.com (March 13, 2025) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Tim Graulich shared his thoughts on the FTX bankruptcy with Dutch publication M&A Magazine. “Many think that chapter 11 only allows for a reorganization, but through chapter 11 you could achieve liquidation,” said Tim. “It is more common for a large company to want to apply for liquidation through chapter 11. It comes as no surprise to me that FTX has opted for a chapter 11 proceeding.”\n\nDiscussing the disappeared crypto assets, Tim noted, “A company will not just miss its factory. These digital assets cannot be removed, unless they are stored in a so-called cold wallet (a digital wallet for crypto assets that is not connected to the internet, ed.) and there is no longer access to that wallet. In that case they are not deleted, but you have lost them. One of the advantages of digital assets is that they are connected to the blockchain and the transaction can therefore be traced. However, a disadvantage is that those assets also remain on the blockchain and are therefore not accessible through third parties.”\n\n“The territorial fight between the different authorities is very interesting here,” Tim continued. “When Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, there was an effort between the various authorities to work together. Under some authorities, that was a written collaboration. We are currently witnessing the way the different authorities deal with each other in this case. There is friction here between the authorities, while they will need each other over time.”\n\nTim also offered advice for potential clients of crypto funds. “Customers are becoming increasingly aware of the fact that they need to do better research,” he said. “If you are a customer of a crypto company, you should be very careful who you do business with. You need to understand the terms, how the business operates, what kind of controls are in place and whether the business is subject to any kind of local regulation. Until you know for sure, it might be wiser to put the crypto back in the cold wallet after a transaction and not leave it on a platform.”\n\n“The settlement of FTX will be a major, complex challenge,” M&A Magazine (January 16, 2023)",

He added that although an increase in biotech deals is a positive sign for those hoping for a broader market rebound in other sectors, it is “not directly transferable.”\n\n“Both biotech and non-biotech IPOs benefit from a lot of the same underlying economic circumstances . . . [but] there are some specific biotech factors such as increased M&A activity in the space, and enthusiasm from specialist biotech investors who are key buyers,” Yasin explained.\n\n“US biotech fundraising boom ends 2-year deal drought,” Financial Times (February 12, 2024) (subscription required)",

According to Brian, “venue reform feels like political overkill for a problem that’s largely already been solved, if it ever existed,” and  “clear, uniform nationwide legislation describing strict requirements for nonconsensual non-debtor releases would be the best way forward.”\n\n“The Professionals Weigh In.

    "text": "Davis Polk Investment Management practice head Leor Landa was quoted in Private Equity Law Report discussing the SEC Divisions of Examinations’ 2024 examination priorities.\n\nHistorically, the SEC engaged with the industry before major rulemakings went into effect, so there was a sense of the regulator’s approach before compliance dates, Leor noted. “That does not seem to be occurring to the same extent lately and the SEC seems more inclined to provide substantive feedback and guidance indirectly through examinations, which can be a challenge for the industry.”\n\nOne of the priorities emphasized is verifying that fund managers are meeting contractual requirements regarding LP advisory committees (LPACs). There seems to be some concerning movement toward the SEC intervening in contractual arrangements between GPs (General Partners) and LPs (Limited Partners), notwithstanding that many LPs are well resourced, heavily represented and have significant bargaining power, Leor said. Investor organizations are not calling for change on that front, and regulatory intervention may skew the markets in potentially inefficient ways.\n\nIn the last few years, there has been a focus on side-by-side management and how managers ensure they allocate investment opportunities and resources fairly, Leor continued. There are real conflicts of interest, but they are obvious, and managers tend to navigate them thoughtfully, often by implementing formulaic processes that can be applied impartially or by defining the investment strategies in a way that avoids overlap, he noted.\n\nThe SEC also noted it would review portfolio management risks, which may include private funds experiencing poor performance. The focus on poor performance is interesting, Leor said. The SEC seems to be mindful of the impact the 2008 global financial crisis had, especially as to leverage runs or liquidity mismatching. However, the market has shifted its approach toward managing liquidity in times of stress, and any future recession should not result in such traumatic consequences, he added.\n\nAnother priority will be verifying that due diligence practices are consistent with a firm’s policies. The focus on the due diligence of portfolio companies is part of a trend for the SEC to second guess business judgments, Leor said. In a number of exams, and sometimes in deficiency letters, the SEC has criticized investment risk or financial decisions. “Provided they meet their regulatory obligations, it is the purview of managers to make decisions about appropriate risks, not the SEC,” he reasoned.\n\n“If a manager is ignoring its disclosure and not doing what it told LPs it would do, that is fair game for the SEC,” Leor continued. “But let’s not stray into an area where managers feel like they’re not allowed to operate with a normal level of discretion or take into account variables.”\n\nLeor also noted that there has been a lot of SEC enforcement activity around fees and expenses, explaining that recent SEC exams have been looking at:\n\n“The issue regularly arises in exams now so it would not be surprising if more enforcement actions follow,” he said.\n\nAn additional focus has been on policies and procedures for reporting on Form PF. Focusing on Form PF reporting seems to reflect the SEC’s generally more aggressive approach toward exams and enforcement, Leor said. The SEC monitors changes to Form PF and considers whether that should trigger an exam, so it is important to the regulator that updates are reported promptly, he explained.\n\nOne notable omission in the list is artificial intelligence (AI). An AI exam sweep of private fund managers is underway and the SEC has spent considerable time in that area, so it was surprising that it was only mentioned in a list of emerging financial technologies, Leor said.\n\n“2024 SEC Examination Priorities: New Approaches to Old Areas of Concern,” Private Equity Law Report (December 14, 2023) (subscription required)",

FinCEN has yet to issue a final rule revising its CDD Rule to align it with the Corporate Transparency Act and Anti-Money Laundering Act.\n\nDan noted that for the time being, bank secrecy act officers “should continue to focus on compliance with the beneficial ownership requirements of the existing CDD Rule.”\n\n“Those requirements will remain applicable until the revised CDD Rule has been finalized and is effective and that could take a long time; FinCEN has not even begun the rulemaking to make conforming changes to the Rule, and the proposed rule will surely generate a large number of comments from the industry that will have to be reviewed and analyzed,” Dan explained. “FinCEN has indicated that banks’ and other financial institutions’ access to the [BOI database] will ‘roughly coincide’ with the revisions of the existing CDD Rule, so such access is still a long ways off.”\n\nIn the meantime, Dan advised that financial institutions may “want to think about how they will obtain their customers’ consent to access the [data].”\n\n“OUTLOOK 2024 - Beneficial ownership registers: U.S. database launches, UK Companies House overhaul begins,” Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence (January 25, 2024) (subscription required)",

These instruments are more appealing to companies looking to raise capital as the conversion price for the convertible debt is at a premium to market price, so that the company is effectively selling stock at a higher price,” Michael explained.\n\nIn terms of the high-yield bond market, Jason noted that for a long time, loose monetary policy allowed companies facing distress to delay restructuring by accessing very favorable bank or bond financing. He added that “the thesis for highly levered companies doesn’t hold together when you’re paying a coupon of 11% or 12% versus 5% or 6%.”\n\nJason also explained that the combination of higher interest payments and declining cash flows – especially in consumer-facing industries – will be a challenge for high-yield-rated companies.\n\n“Fed Rate Increases Upended Funding Markets in 2022.

Do not say ‘no’ to yourself in terms of pursuing potential opportunities, let others say ‘no’ to you. Also, be curious and keep abreast of developments in your area of practice – it will make you a much better practitioner.”\n\nThe list of “Women in Antitrust” was published on May 21, 2025.",

We often are being asked to tackle issues of first impression, take on enormously complex matters and handle cases that will have enormous impacts on our clients. We come together and work as a team. When a client hires one of us, they get all of us, or at least those of us with the applicable experience for the particular matter. All of our clients are Davis Polk clients, not clients of individual partners.”\n\n“Litigation Leaders: Davis Polk’s Jim Rouhandeh on Recruiting and Training Top-Flight Associates—’the Lifeblood of the Firm,’” AmLaw Litigation Daily (January 3, 2023)",

The video unites more than 100 of the world’s greatest drummers and percussionists for a drum-focused cover of The Beatles’ song “Come Together.”\n\nSince the campaign launched, it has raised nearly $600,000 for WhyHunger, a nonprofit that works to end hunger and barriers to access to nutritious food. Regarding the incredible impact of the project, Brian told Law360, “I’m thrilled we get to support this wonderful charity. They do amazing work. Six hundred thousand dollars could feed over 400,000 people.”\n\nBrian, who won a Tony Award as co-producer of Hadestown, was inspired to create Drum Together in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. He said, “I felt like this would be a unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity with all of the drummers home and not on the road for them to record their parts and see if we could, for the first time ever, get 161 musicians and over 100 top drummers to play together on the same video on the same song. It was a big, grand experiment and it ended up being a huge success.”\n\nOn October 19, 2021, WhyHunger honored Brian with the Harry Chapin Humanitarian Award, in recognition of his longtime support of the organization and his work on Drum Together.\n\nRead the Law360 article",

It is referred to as the so-called “death penalty provision,” but has never been used.\n\nThe article notes that in some cases, banks implicated in money laundering have pleaded guilty to alternative crimes, which has averted a regulatory hearing on whether to revoke the bank’s charter. In other situations, banks have entered into deferred prosecution agreements with law enforcement, which allow the banks to avoid pleading guilty if they adhere to certain conditions.\n\nDan explained that a regulatory hearing to revoke a bank’s charter after a criminal conviction for money laundering may lead to bigger problems than those tied to a single bank’s risk management. “If it’s a bank of any consequence, that would be very disruptive for the bank, but not just for the bank,” he said. “If it’s a significant enough bank, it could have consequences for the broader financial system and economy.”\n\nDan said that he would be surprised if a bank broke from precedent by pleading guilty to money laundering.\n\nHe added that on one hand, it’s probably frustrating to the Department of Justice when it puts together a strong money laundering case but instead enters a deferred prosecution agreement or goes for a conviction on lighter charges to avoid jostling the financial system. On the other hand, regulators and law enforcement have taken heat from politicians in the past when banks’ anti-money-laundering programs fail and those banks still don’t face the possibility of charter revocation.\n\n“Typically the way these things play out in the real world is that it never really comes to this,” Dan explained.\n\n“The anti-money-laundering lever that regulators have never used,” American Banker (October 4, 2024) (subscription required)",

Commissioner and its impact with Bloomberg Tax.\n\nIn Varian, the first case to consider the validity of a Treasury regulation after Loper Bright (in which the U.S. Supreme Court rejected the longstanding Chevron doctrine), the Tax Court invalidated the regulation in question and ruled that the taxpayer was entitled to the favorable tax treatment provided by a statutory mismatch in effective dates between the new Section 245A and a corresponding change to Section 78.\n\nThe article notes that more companies are starting to see significant benefits from the ruling and are taking similar deductions. How much each company benefits from the Varian ruling can differ, depending on factors such as each company’s tax structure and how much in foreign dividends it received from its affiliates. That’s “sort of exactly what we were anticipating,” Chris explained.\n\n“Cisco, Booking Get Big Tax Benefits From Varian Court Ruling,” Bloomberg Tax (December 2, 2024) (subscription required)",

I think a lot of things have been waiting for Michael Barr, including this.”\n\n“[Barr has] been very thoughtful and sophisticated in his testimony,” she continued, “And I think a lot of people have been waiting for him not only to be in the room, but to get briefed and in a place where he can bring a nuanced point of view.”\n\n“Banking Regulation To Watch In 2023,” Law360 (January 2, 2023) (subscription required)",

Dan also noted that because the priorities are very high level, they raise some questions as to how FinCEN expects financial institutions to incorporate them into their AML efforts. Although not all of these priorities will be applicable to all financial institutions, to the extent they are applicable, the bank will be expected to assess the risks and then calibrate their programmes accordingly, Dan explained.\n\n“U.S. Publishes First National AML Priorities,” VIXIO (July 13, 2021) (subscription required)",

Dan noted that following the financial crisis of 2008, regulators found that AML at banks had fallen through the cracks while those institutions were focused on survival. He explained that the consequences of such lapses can include fines, expenses to update AML systems that divert resources from other operations, reputational damage, and consent orders, which can torpedo growth strategies like mergers and acquisitions.\n\nDan highlighted that a common thread in many major AML cases is that the strength of the bank’s compliance program and the risk levels of its clients and services aren’t aligned. Professional money launderers are adept at finding weak links in banks’ compliance systems. He said that preventing major crimes should be a joint effort between banks and law enforcement agencies, since banks are uniquely positioned to see the side of crimes – moving money – that law enforcement doesn’t.\n\nDan also added that banks should be expected to identify and report suspicious activity before letting law enforcement officials take the investigations from there.\n\n“‘Tougher before it gets better’: TD faces a long road on AML woes,” American Banker (May 16, 2024) (subscription required)",

The article notes that the majority of troubled companies that have initiated LMEs this year turned to their existing lenders to raise new money rather than turning to third-party lenders. However, advisors to companies and sponsors often reach out to existing lenders with the threat of potential third-party proposals.\n\n“So much of the broadly syndicated market has now concentrated in a small handful of institutional investors that sponsors don’t really want to blow up their term loans or secured notes if they don’t have to,” Damian explained.\n\n“They want to maintain that threat. If no one ever does a deal away, it becomes less of a threat against the existing lenders in the next deal,” Damian added.\n\n“LME trends — Creditor-led LMEs dwarf third-party financing deals,” 9fin (October 23, 2024) (subscription required)",

In discussing this increase, Ted notes that AI is “the flavor of the day for plaintiffs’ lawyers,” and that the plaintiffs’ bar is using hindsight to claim companies “should have anticipated more, back when AI was less of a focus than it is currently.”\n\nAddressing the report’s findings on the increase in big-dollar cases measured by drops in market capitalization, Ted said, “I suspect that reflects greater volatility in the market. These likely reflect non-company-specific macroeconomic factors, which may have had a disproportionate impact on some companies.”\n\nAI, Big-Dollar Suits Dominate Data on New Investor Class Actions Bloomberg Law (July 31, 2025) (subscription required)",

Luigi said that the absence of a collaborative process concerns him because all three agencies use the same application form, and it raises the possibility that the OCC might view a transaction differently than the other two agencies. “I worry about individual federal banking agencies putting out individual policy statements [and] expressing their own individual agency views on statutory standards instead of developing an interagency approach,” he said.\n\n“Is America’s Banking System the System It Needs?”,” Bank Director (April 10, 2024) (subscription required)",

The Supreme Court will decide whether the NBA preempts a New York law requiring national banks and other lenders to pay 2% interest on mortgage escrow accounts.\n\nThe brief states that the OCC has consistently performed its role of overseeing and protecting the national banking system and concluded - over decades and across administrations - that state law may not compel national banks to pay interest on escrow accounts. The OCC has consistently taken the position that, under Barnett Bank, state laws conflict with a federal power vested in national banks when they attempt to control or hinder the exercise of that power.\n\nDan served for more than 30 years at the OCC, including as Deputy Chief Counsel and Acting Chief Counsel and Senior Deputy Comptroller, in both Democratic and Republican Administrations. In these roles, Dan supervised the preparation of briefs submitted on behalf of the OCC in federal preemption cases, including Watters v. Wachovia Bank, N.A. and Cuomo v.

The government charged Palma in 2019 with allegedly conspiring to violate the Clean Air Act by manipulating U.S. emissions tests in connection with FCA’s diesel versions of the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Ram 1500 vehicles.\n\nAfter initially facing over 20 years in prison based on the 2019 indictment, Palma pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to violate the Clean Air Act in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371. Pursuant to a plea agreement, the government agreed not to object to a non-custodial sentence and did not oppose Palma’s recommendation of a time-served sentence.\n\nThe Davis Polk team also included associates Meredith Manning, Shiva Jayaraman, Brooke Theodora, Christian Hines, Michelle Musielewicz, Jennifer Butwin, Stephanie Hansen, Isabella Nolan, Akhil Sud, Ted Ibargüen, Paul Shortell, Kennedi Williams-Libert and Jessica Barragan.\n\n“Litigator of the Week Runners-Up and Shout Outs,” AmLaw Litigation Daily (November 17, 2023) (subscription required)",

He and I have, for years, been on the phone at or after 11pm, probably three nights a week, week after week, about this very challenging and demanding case. Marc’s dedication and sheer appetite for incredibly hard work in very difficult situations is almost without parallel.”\n\nMarshall noted that Marc took on a bankruptcy case “with complexities that virtually no other case has ever had. I really don’t know where we would be without him.”\n\n“A Tale Of Two GCs And The OxyContin Scandals,” Law360 (June 18, 2025) (subscription required)",

Even ordinary banking activities are hard now because of the sanctions on banks. De-risking efforts and the prevailing market conditions have put a chill on even permissible activities.”\n\nOutside of the U.S., Paul noted that, in some ways, E.U. and U.K. measures go further by expanding restrictions on the export of certain services, including IT consultancy, certain legal advice, and architecture and engineering services.\n\nIn terms of compliance issues, Uzo discussed the new trend of compliance notes being issued jointly by the DOJ, the Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Bureau of Industry and Security. “The first of these tri-seal compliance notes, was published in March, and focused on various ways in which Russia and other bad actors have used third party intermediaries to evade sanctions,” Uzo said. “The note identified red flags that could indicate a third-party intermediary is attempting to evade sanctions or export controls.”\n\nEffective compliance programs will need to adopt controls to minimize the risk of evasion and misuse by third-party intermediaries.\n\nMargarita rounded out the webinar highlighting several cases of federal agencies enforcing rules against individual intermediaries of sanctioned persons and entities, who were found to be using complex schemes to facilitate transactions that evaded sanctions.\n\n“Measures Against Russia Pose Serious Compliance Challenges,” Anti-Corruption Report (September 27, 2023) (subscription required)",

They have an impressive track record of successfully leading complex restructurings, and their practice complements the market-leading work of our distinguished restructuring team in the U.S.,” said Neil Barr, Davis Polk’s Managing Partner. “Europe is an increasingly important area of focus for our restructuring clients. As we continue to build out our corporate practice in London, including through the exciting growth we have seen in leveraged finance and private equity already this year, adding top-tier restructuring capabilities is a natural next step.”\n\nMr. Cader advises clients on all facets of European insolvencies and restructurings. He works with private equity firms, hedge funds, investment banks and other distressed debt and par investors, providing advice on their investment portfolios. He also has advised insolvency practitioners. He is widely recognized as a leading restructuring practitioner, including in the Legal 500 UK and Chambers UK, where a client notes that he is “a superstar” who “has been highly impactful on very complex transactions.”\n\nMr. Knight has deep experience in complex, multi-jurisdictional workouts and restructurings, acting for both creditors and debtors. He works with private equity houses, hedge funds and other investors with respect to the acquisition and reorganization of stressed and distressed businesses. His practice includes all stages of the restructuring life cycle, including investment structuring, contingency planning and strategy, negotiations, implementation, post-restructuring, optimization of existing investments and exit. Mr. Knight is ranked by multiple industry publications, including the Chambers UK, which notes that clients have called him “outstanding” and “a highly commercial-and client-focused lawyer.”\n\nThe duo joins Davis Polk from Sidley Austin LLP, where they served as co-heads of the Restructuring group in London.\n\n“Jifree and Mark are very well known and well respected in the market,” said Damian Schaible, co-head of Davis Polk’s Restructuring practice. “They have deep relationships with and are trusted by a wide range of sophisticated investors in Europe, many of whom are already clients of our firm, from their excellent work advising both companies and creditors in restructurings across the globe.”\n\n“Jifree and Mark are a fantastic team,” said Marshall Huebner, co-head of Davis Polk’s Restructuring practice. “They will be a huge asset to our existing clients and will help expand our client portfolio in Europe and beyond. We are thrilled they are joining our team.”\n\nMr. Cader received his LL.B. from the University of Westminster. Mr. Knight received a B.A. from the University of Birmingham and a Graduate Diploma in Law from The College of Law at Guildford.",

    "text": "Davis Polk partners Kyoko Takahashi Lin and Veronica Wissel were quoted in Anti-Corruption Report discussing the potential effects and considerations for the FTC’s ban on non-compete clauses. The rule, which is expected to go into effect in September unless its proponents prevail, would almost entirely ban non-compete clauses, with the exception of those that already exist for senior executives.\n\nRegarding who is included in the exception, Kyoko noted that it could include people in positions such as Chief Commercial Officer (CCO) or chief information security officer (CISO). “The threshold question is whether they are an executive officer. Some companies may take the view that they are,” she said.\n\nVeronica added that Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, serves as a good guideline for determining who might qualify under the Final Rule’s exemption within publicly traded companies. She noted that “The FTC rule’s definition of senior executive is similar, and is even a bit narrower than the Section 16 definition.” However, she also said private companies would have more flexibility to decide who is a “senior executive” since they have not yet made the determination of policy-making roles for other purposes.\n\nKyoko agreed, saying, “if they are at a public company, we would first need to see if they are a Section 16 officer – and some CCOs, CPOs and CISOs are and others are not.”\n\nVeronica noted that some companies may try to achieve a similar result by getting “more aggressive” with non-disclosure, non-solicitation or non-disparagement clauses.\n\nKyoko expanded on that, noting, “If non-competes are banned, confidentiality or trade secrets covenants may be the primary remaining contractual protection. So, we are encouraging companies, whatever happens with this rule, to look at their other existing covenants to make sure they have the best protection.”\n\nHowever, Veronica warned that if a company seeks “to enforce those provisions as a pure end-run around the non-compete ban, then it may face FTC scrutiny.”\n\n“It is hard to stop people from taking another job on the grounds that they are going to disclose, disparage or solicit. If a company took the view that someone could not take another job without doing those things, the FTC could say that is tantamount to a non-compete,” she continued.\n\nHowever, Kyoko believes the FTC’s Final Rule is somewhat unlikely to proceed, given the plethora of different arguments being put forward against it. “There is a low chance of this rule seeing the light of day. More lawsuits may be coming. Those that have been filed put forward very compelling arguments,” she said.\n\nAt the same time, several states have adopted or further tightened prohibitions on non-competes in recent years, which, Kyoko pointed out, “are not subject to the same challenges.”\n\n“How the FTC Non‑Compete Ban Could Impact CCOs and Other Top Executives,” Anti-Corruption Report (May 23, 2024) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk White Collar Defense & Investigations co-heads Greg Andres and Martine Beamon were featured in the National Law Journal’s “Compliance Hot Spots” column, discussing topics ranging from their career paths and leading Davis Polk’s white collar team, to enforcement trends from the DOJ and SEC, to how the pandemic impacted white collar work.\n\nCommenting on the Biden administration’s call for stricter corporate scrutiny, Martine said, “I think there’s a tonal change. The change was intended to embolden line prosecutors to let them know that there’s a new sheriff in town, and that they should be seeking to be aggressive on corporate prosecutions and white-collar prosecutions. Certainly we are hearing about aggressive and searching inquiries in any number of cases—new tactics and a new attitude already.”\n\nMartine and Greg discussed how Davis Polk’s white collar team is particularly well positioned to manage the change, pointing to the team’s balance of lawyers with significant government experience and those who have spent the majority of their career on the defense side. The article highlighted several of the group’s most recent high-profile additions from government, including partners Dan Kahn, Rob Cohen, Tatiana Martins and Uzo Asonye. Greg noted, “We have the ability to represent our clients in different forums in a way that doesn’t require somebody to hire two or three law firms to cover the civil issues, the criminal issues and the congressional issues or the regulatory issues. We can cover all of those in a really efficient way.”\n\n“Compliance Hot Spots: Catching Up with Davis Polk White-Collar Leaders + Ex-Goldman Banker Finally Heads to Trial + Who’s Representing Crypto Couple Accused of Money Laundering?” Law.com (February 9, 2022) (subscription required)",

    "text": "The adolescent years are widely understood to be among the most challenging life stages. For the hundreds of thousands of youths who identify as transgender in the United States, their coming of age is much more difficult.\n\nBoth at and outside of school, transgender young people often face isolation, bullying and discrimination along with rejection from activities and social spaces. Some also suffer from gender dysphoria, which is defined as clinically significant discomfort or distress arising from misalignment between one’s gender identity and their sex assigned at birth or sex-related physical characteristics. Targeting transgender youth, a wave of states – there are currently 25 – have passed prohibitions on various types of evidence-based, medically-recommended gender-affirming care.\n\nMajor national medical and scientific associations including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Pediatric Endocrine Society all recognize gender dysphoria and have set out treatment guidelines that include the same types of gender-affirming care being outlawed nationwide. In 2021, in the early stages of the movement to ban gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth, the American Medical Association urged governors to oppose state legislation of this nature, American Medical Association urged governors to oppose state legislation of this nature, calling it “a dangerous intrusion into the practice of medicine.”\n\nDespite vocal and repeated objections from medical providers, parents and transgender youth, in July 2023, Louisiana’s legislature overturned then-Governor John Bel Edwards’ veto of the Gender Affirming Care Ban (HB648), making Louisiana one more state to ban care.\n\nThe Ban, which went into effect on January 1, 2024, prohibits physicians from providing certain types of gender-affirming medical care, including hormone therapies and puberty blockers, when that care is provided to “validate a minor’s perception of his sex if the minor’s perception of self is inconsistent with his biological sex.” Patients already receiving treatment must transition off care before the end of the one-year titration period, concluding December 31, 2024. These same treatments are prescribed – and can still be prescribed – to youth in Louisiana for reasons other than gender dysphoria, such as the treatment of early-onset puberty. Under the Ban, healthcare professionals who continue to provide genderaffirming care to their minor patients in violation of the Ban face mandatory disciplinary action, including the revocation of their professional licenses, by their occupational or licensing boards. Some qualified healthcare providers have already started to leave the state in response.\n\nThis past January, Davis Polk joined Lambda Legal and the Harvard Law School Center for Health Law and Policy Innovation (CHLPI) in representing five transgender clients ages 10 to 17 and their parents in a lawsuit against the Louisiana Board of Medical Examiners and Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill. The lawsuit, Soe v. Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners, argues that Louisiana’s ban violates the Constitution of the State of Louisiana by discriminating on the basis of sex in violation of rights to equal protection and dignity while also interfering with the parent plaintiffs’ parental autonomy and rights to direct their children’s medical care.\n\nThe minor plaintiffs have all been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, and, with the support of their parents and healthcare providers, have begun to take steps to live in accordance with their gender. This includes changes to their appearance, and, for some plaintiffs where medically-indicated, pubertyblockers or hormone therapy. Our clients reported significant benefits from treatment, including feeling “more themselves,” “more confident” and “less anxious.” As the end of 2024 nears, some of our clients have been told by their physicians, who are concerned about enforcement of the Ban and effect on their licensure, that they should no longer expect treatment at all.\n\nWithout means or support to travel long distances with frequency to a state that does allow gender-affirming treatment (currently, the closest states without bans are New Mexico, Kansas and Illinois), many transgender youth in Louisiana will soon be completely cut off from much needed care.\n\nIn April, the defendants – the State Attorney General and the Louisiana State Board of Medical Examiners – moved to hear the case in East Baton Rouge Parish instead of New Orleans in Orleans Parish, where our clients receive treatment, and where both their medical providers and the Board of Medical Examiners are based. Civil Litigation associate Deborah Mazer argued and won a decision from the bench to keep the case in Orleans Parish. This bench decision was subsequently appealed by the defendants to the Louisiana Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal.\n\nSome members of the Davis Polk team, White Collar Defense & Investigations counsel Gabe Jaime-Bettan and Litigation associates Anna Fish and Leah Samuel, accompanied Deborah to Louisiana for the hearing and to meet with the clients in person for the first time following many virtual meetings. Through a gathering the Davis Polk team and co-counsel organized at a Mexican restaurant, the clients were also able to meet one another for the first time.\n\n“The team had this wonderful idea of creating bingo cards that had different factoids about people, and we played a game where we all had to walk around the room, mingle and find people who met those criteria – things like ‘I’m an only child’ or ‘I can name every Taylor Swift album.’ We were all looking for the Swifties in the group,” Gabe shared. “The kids were so into it.”\n\nAfter an evening of getting to know one another, dancing, showing off their art and playing games, Deborah said that “one of the clients told me that she was just so happy to be around other transgender kids and see their range of ages and gender expressions.”\n\n“In discovery, we’ve gotten a number of really aggressive requests from the defendants for deeply personal information about our clients, so it’s been helpful to have met in-person and already established a connection going into this process,” Gabe said. He explained that, given the subject matter, discovery would necessarily be intrusive for the clients. “But now that the clients have all met, they know other people who are going through this too.”\n\nWith hopes of a trial as close to the end of the titration period as possible (when care for gender dysphoria will entirely cease to exist in Louisiana), the Davis Polk team is conducting discovery and working to build a strong case against the Ban.",

    "text": "Davis Polk Financial Institutions practice head Margaret Tahyar was quoted in IFLR on banking regulation in 2024.\n\nDiscussing the Basel III endgame proposals announced in 2023, Margaret said, “[Federal Reserve] vice chair Michael Barr has been saying that he is seeking broad consensus among board members, but not unanimity. There’s some signaling that adjustments will be made, but what those might be is anybody’s guess.”\n\n“On the regulatory reform front, 2024 is going to be even busier than 2023: we’re now about to enter a supercycle and a lot is going to happen,” she noted. “If you look back to 2023, items such as the Community Reinvestment Act and the FDIC’s special assessment rule were finalized. But there is a ton of proposed regulations and guidance out there still awaiting finalization.”\n\nMargaret noted that the banking crisis in 2023 has influenced the content of proposals so far and will continue to have an impact on regulators’ choices. “Following the banking crisis in March, we’ve had a real tightening in bank supervision, and we will continue to see a much tighter and stricter supervisory environment going into next year,” she said. “We are dealing with the fallout from this year’s banking crisis and are expecting increases in enforcement orders.”\n\nDiscussing the expected update to bank merger guidelines, Margaret said, “There’s a vivid discussion going on among the banking agencies and the DOJ, but I’m not sure they’ve settled on a position yet. Presumably, when a proposal comes up it will have a relatively major effect, because there’s so much going on in terms of what ought to be happening in big mergers.”\n\n“It’s probable that new goals are being set now – it’s just unclear what they are at this stage,” she continued. “A rethink of the logic around mergers at certain asset sizes seems imperative, particularly in light of some technological investments that are going to be needed.”\n\nShe added that it remains to be seen what the effects of a reform around banking M&A would be on normal mergers versus troubled ones in the back half of 2024 and front half of 2025.\n\nMargaret also noted that the SEC’s climate disclosure rules, which may be finalized before the end of the year, will have meaningful consequences on the banking sector. “A lot of what the SEC does is having an impact on large banking organizations, even though it’s not banking regulation per se,” she explained. “The climate-related disclosures cover public companies at large, and many of the major banking institutions tend to be public. Equally, regional banks’ holding companies are typically public. So, the impact will be major.”\n\nA crucial question is whether scope 3 requirements – which cover third-party emissions in the value chain – will be included in the final text. “Those will be very difficult to gather for banking organizations,” Margaret said.\n\n“2024, US banking regulation ‘supercycle’,” IFLR (December 12, 2023)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner and Financial Institutions practice head Margaret Tahyar discussed what to watch as bank earnings are announced and what the data could mean for potential bank reforms on Bloomberg Television’s “Bloomberg Markets: The Close.”\n\nWhen asked what she thinks regulators will be watching, Margaret said, “I think the regulators already have the data. As part of their supervisory duties, they’ve been talking to banks all around the country and probably getting, in some cases, twice daily updates from banks on what they’re seeing.” She added, “I’d be surprised if the supervisors or the regulators are surprised by anything.”\n\nShe also shared her thoughts on investor concerns regarding FDIC insurance. “The key thing that I think is happening on deposits is the coverage cap. There’s just a big swirl around, should that be raised and how will that work,” she explained, noting that there are many options for next steps and that the FDIC’s report on deposit insurance will be released next month. When asked if she thinks if the cap should be raised, she responded, “I’m holding fire. I have this probably old-fashioned view, which is data first and policy second.”\n\nMargaret also addressed differing messages coming from two different FDIC directors on what is to blame for recent bank failures. “It’s pretty unusual,” she explained. “There are two interesting things going on there. They obviously are saying quite different things about the 2018 bipartisan law – Director Chopra is saying it is responsible for a lot of it, and Vice Chair Hill is saying, no it’s not. Both of them are saying, we need to think about targeted reforms to match the situation. And interestingly, both are holding fire and urging caution on, how do we raise the insurance coverage.”\n\nMargaret continued. “I’m hoping we’ll have a lot more data after the earnings season to inform where we might go with increases in deposit insurance coverage – which by the way, requires Congress to act, and that is a challenge.”\n\n“Bloomberg Markets: The Close,” Bloomberg Television (starting at the 1:58:46 mark) (April 13, 2023)",

Most notably, the voluntary disclosure program was significantly expanded – a company may still receive a declination even if aggravating circumstances are present. The organization must have disclosed promptly, engaged in extraordinary cooperation and remediation, and have had an effective compliance program at the time of the incident.\n\nDan added that companies should “stay the course” when it comes to prioritizing compliance, regardless of the change in administration.\n\n“Dan Kahn on the Latest Changes from the DOJ,” Compliance Perspectives (January 9, 2025)",

    "text": "For many transgender people, having a legal identity that aligns with their lived experience is not only important psychologically, but it ensures that they will face fewer barriers when seeking out employment, education and public benefits. To support low-income members of the transgender, gender non-conforming and non-binary community, lawyers from Davis Polk and client Con Edison have joined together to volunteer with the Name Change Project, administered by the Transgender Legal Defense & Education Fund (TLDEF).\n\nTo discuss this pro bono work, we sat down with Jillian Berman, Davis Polk Pro Bono Counsel for Corporate & Transactional Matters, and Mary Krayeske, Con Edison Assistant General Counsel.\n\nMary and Jillian, can you describe your roles at Con Edison and Davis Polk, respectively?\n\nMary: I have been at Con Ed for over 30 years. Currently, I do cyber, privacy and regulatory work, including dealing with energy efficiency, electric vehicles and other clean energy future proceedings.\n\nJillian: In my role, I work with lawyers across the firm representing nonprofits, small businesses and entrepreneurs on a wide range of matters. I also lead several projects that don’t fit squarely into the corporate or transactional banner. These include senior law matters, election protection efforts and our transgender name change practice.\n\nHow did you each come to be involved in the TLDEF Name Change Project?\n\nJillian: When I rejoined Davis Polk as a pro bono lawyer two years ago, I was eager to get involved in this space. I’ve seen through the experiences of my own friends and family the weight a name can carry, and the corresponding importance of having a name that matches your lived experience.\n\nMary: A friend of mine at another law firm suggested that I try the name change petitions, so I did one or two and realized how helpful and easy they were to work on. I subsequently joined Con Edison’s pro bono committee and shared with them the opportunity to get more lawyers involved in working on these petitions.\n\nJillian, can you tell us more about the barriers clients face before they secure a legal name change? What are the ramifications of one’s identity not lining up with what’s on paper?\n\nJillian: People whose documents reflect a name or picture inconsistent with their identity risk being questioned or outed when seeking, among other things, jobs, housing, health care services and public health benefits. At best, this may lead those individuals to avoid those settings and services to their own detriment, leading to or increasing economic and physical marginalization and poor health outcomes. At worst, they may be opening themselves up to harassment, discrimination and violence. The dissonance between someone’s documentation and their gender identity can also, of course, have a profound emotional and psychological impact that can’t be underestimated.\n\nWhat was your experience participating in the Name Change Project?\n\nMary: My experience has been very positive. The name change petitions are not terribly complicated to work on – they were streamlined a few years back – but they make a real difference in our transgender clients’ lives. Many of the Project’s clients have a hard time because of their minority status; it can be very helpful for them to get documentation that reflects who they truly are.\n\nJillian: In the last two years I’ve worked with over two dozen name change clients, and with each there is something unique about either the work or the client that stands out. Our clients are at all different places in their own lives, both with respect to their gender but also more broadly, and I’m constantly learning from them through the process. However, one thing that is consistent is the palpable joy and relief clients exude when they receive their name change orders. It is truly life-changing.\n\nMary, what makes pro bono work meaningful to you?\n\nMary: Pro bono work is meaningful to me because it is both an opportunity to give back and an opportunity to learn something new. As a lawyer, I have a unique skill set  – I was very fortunate to have the ability  to go to law school – and I want to use that training to give back. I also always try to do something different for pro bono work so that I learn about new areas or develop new skills.\n\nWhat, if any, other types of pro bono work do you have experience with?\n\nMary: Maintaining a diverse pro bono practice is important to me, so I have done a number of different types of pro bono work over the years. In addition to the transgender name change petitions, I’ve done bankruptcy matters and worked on a petition concerning violence against women; I’m currently working on an excessive sentencing petition. A few years ago, I represented a worker in a workers’ compensation case related to the September 11th attacks.\n\nMary, what advice would you offer to other in-house lawyers considering taking on pro bono work?\n\nMary: There’s a good feeling in being able to give back, and I find that there are always ways to make time for pro bono work if you are committed to doing it. Sometimes that means doing the work on a Saturday or on a long plane ride, but, if it is important to you, you will find a way to make time for it.\n\nJillian, from your perspective, what are the benefits of partnering with corporate clients on pro bono projects?\n\nJillian: Partnering on pro bono projects with a corporate client allows firm lawyers to see different sides of the in-house lawyers they work with day-to-day, which in turn can deepen these relationships and have a positive spillover effect into their billable work. Corporate in-house lawyers also bring a fresh perspective to these pro bono matters, for example with issue-spotting, since they approach things through a slightly different lens then we are used to. The collaboration with Con Ed has been particularly rewarding, as the Con Ed lawyers are consistently enthusiastic, smart and as committed to the work as we are.\n\nLearn more about Davis Polk’s Pro Bono program.",

That may look like a return to the priorities detailed in a 2021 interagency policy sprint on crypto-related activities, when bank regulators said they would address custody standards, facilitation of purchases and sales of crypto assets, loans collateralized by crypto payments-related activities, including stablecoin, and holding crypto assets to principal.\n\n“I would expect all of those to be on the table again,” he said.\n\n“Crypto Heads Into 2025 Hoping Regulatory Clouds Will Clear,” Law360 (January 1, 2025) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner David Portilla was quoted in IFLR discussing updated bank merger guidelines.\n\nIn September, the OCC, the FDIC and the DOJ made policy announcements on how they intend to look at bank mergers. David noted that the analysis of bank mergers will change because the regulators set out a lot of detail to describe how they would be changing it.\n\n“We don’t know how it will change until meaningful transactions are put before the agencies. There will be uncertainty until we see the policy adjustments,” he said.\n\n“Large transactions are still viable,” he continued, “but they require a new style of analysis than would have been the case prior to the DOJ and the agencies announcing their new approach.”\n\nDiscussing how the election in November could impact the approach to bank mergers, David said, “Any election will have an impact, but it’s really hard to tell how. The old maxim that the personnel is the policy is a good one. Until you know who the personnel are, it’s hard to know how things will be affected.”\n\n“US bank mergers still challenging for clients, say lawyers,” IFLR (October 14, 2024) (subscription required)",

He said, “Folks should really be thinking about these areas where things might change and what actions they might want to take in response. For example, it’s time for banks that are interested in engaging in M&A activity to start thinking about that and making plans.”\n\n“Lawyers advise clients to prepare now for US regulatory changeover,” IFLR (November 11, 2024) (subscription required)",

Sanofi et al., which was decided by the Supreme Court, held that antibody patents need to disclose the full scope of the invention in order to meet enablement requirements under Section 112 of the Patent Act. While the specific case was focused on functional claiming for antibody-based patents, it could impact other industries, according to Ashok.\n\n“[The justices] specifically made it clear that it applies to processes, to even things one might think of as high-tech innovations,” he said.\n\nDiscussing, Ironburg Inventions Ltd. v. Valve Corp., which clarified what arguments for invalidity can be raised in district court, Ashok said he doesn’t believe the skilled searcher requirement will have a big impact — “unless you have the situation of a thesis that’s not available online, and only found in some obscure research library somewhere.”\n\nHowever, he said the Federal Circuit had an important “clear articulation” for the burden of proof when raising estoppel defenses. The district court in the case said the burden was on the accused infringer, but the Federal Circuit said it should be on the patent owner, since it’s the one invoking estoppel.\n\n“The Biggest Patent Rulings Of 2023,” Law360 (December 13, 2023) (subscription required)",

Plus, the secondaries market has obviously exploded as a tool to hold onto high-performing, fee-generating assets for longer. What people are not talking about as much, but need to, is that it has been a long winter and it’s clear that some firms were better prepared than others.”\n\nPointing to a few bright spots in the fundraising environment, Andrew noted, “It has been the case that cumulative fundraising totals have been and will be flatter for a while, but if you compare the total amount of capital raised last year to where we were a decade ago, it is still dramatically higher.”\n\nSpeaking about what counsel can bring to the table, Andrew said, “While we are not placement agents and we do not raise capital for our sponsors, we can help managers strategize and better understand the market and creative tools at their potential disposal. We provide strategic advice to sponsors regarding the types of GP-led transactions to pursue based on their objectives and the state of play of their portfolio.”\n\n“In more challenging times, creativity will attract a premium and having a service provider that understands this can be critical,” Michael added. “That means having not just the ability to access other expertise within the firm, but also the ability to provide a certain amount of therapy and guidance.”\n\n“Ready for the fundraising spring,” Private Equity International (April 1, 2025)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner and IP & Commercial Transactions practice head Frank Azzopardi was quoted in 9Fin discussing the increase in private credit investment in college sports due to a recently approved settlement that allows direct payments from colleges to student athletes.\n\nThe article noted that some schools will have to contend with extra costs or risk being outcompeted, which has opened the doors to direct lenders to invest in college sports. “Everything has changed considerably with the House settlement and the fact that these athletic programs are essentially now having taken a hit to their bottom line. They’re trying to come up with creative ways to be able to meet these payments to these athletes,” Frank said.\n\nThe clarifications around NIL sponsorships and revenue sharing have brought more certainty to college sports investments and builds on the momentum that professional sports have gained as an asset class in recent years.\n\n“Look at all the professional sports in the US, their media rights have all been growing. And if you look at it internationally the same is true as well,” he noted. “With the college landscape, given that they’ve all been essentially run like non-profit enterprises without much involvement with outside credit and outside investment, I think some see an opportunity to potentially disrupt that and get involved.”\n\nHowever, Frank mentioned that public universities need to be sensitive to any state laws that may restrict the purposes for which they can raise debt.\n\n“There are issues to consider, public universities need to be sensitive to any state laws that may restrict the purposes for which they can raise debt,” he said. “As a non-profit, [those institutions] can’t enter into transactions with a for-profit entity that would impair [their] non-for-profit status. So the transaction has to be structured in a way that threads that needle.”\n\n“Colleges are paying athletes — private credit wants to play ball,” 9Fin (July 16, 2025) (subscription required)",

In my second year of law school, I took ‘Individual Income Tax’ and ‘Corporate Income Tax’ with Marty Ginsberg [husband of the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg] … and I just absolutely fell in love with [tax] as a discipline. I liked it because it was business, it was case law, it was regulatory, it was statutory, and so the depth of what you got in a tax practice and the cross-disciplinary nature of it was tremendously appealing to me.”\n\nDiscussing his role as the firm’s Managing Partner, he said, “I very much enjoy engaging with people. … I have a lot of fun professionally helping people achieve their goals, motivate them, think about their careers in a way that might be a little bit different, going out and talking to clients. I just really love the people aspect of this business.”\n\nWhen asked about what he learned during his first year as Managing Partner, Neil answered, “While a law firm leader is ultimately responsible for the outcome of the organization, in the context of a human capital business, consensus building is an exceedingly important part of the job.”\n\nSpeaking about issues he faces as a law firm leader in today’s environment, Neil noted, “How partners are compensated is a very important part of the job, it’s a very important part of the competitive dynamic at the moment, and it feeds into a second issue, which is the importance in this environment of retaining the best talent and recruiting the best talent…[Also,] making sure that our practices are appropriately sized for the right market opportunities, so making sure the scale and positioning of a particular practice is sensible in relation to the market opportunity.”\n\nHe also highlighted the importance of culture, noting, “We pride ourselves on being a team-oriented, firm-first, client-outcomes-are-most-important type of law firm. We think our brand is very much enhanced by the fact that we have absolutely exceptional lawyers here who consistently deliver great outcomes for our clients, and making sure that the client being first and the clients’ outcome being first is not lost in this increasingly competitive shuffle that is the law firm business is an important part of that. And part of making sure that the client outcome is the best possible client outcome is creating an internal culture that gets the best team focused on the client’s issues with the least friction possible.”\n\nTouching on the most critical issues facing the industry over the next five years, Neil points to three buckets: 1) those inherent to the legal industry, including “lateral partners, the concept of the ‘nonequity’ tier of partners, how big law firms need to be to remain competitive;” 2) issues related to the macroeconomic environment; and 3) issues around technological innovation, including generative AI.\n\n“Drinks With The Deal: Davis Polk’s Barr Discusses Compensation, Comcast,” Drinks with The Deal (January 30, 2025)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Luigi De Ghenghi was quoted in the American Banker discussing the bank regulators’ proposed changes to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR), which determines the minimum amount of equity banks must hold relative to their assets.\n\nLuigi said that the idea that capital would be shifted from bank depositories to their holding companies is “misplaced,” noting that such a transfer would not only face mechanical hurdles – namely that doing so would count as a dividend that would be subject to regulatory approval – but it would also be imprudent management.\n\n“At both the holding company level and bank level, you’re still going to manage yourself to these buffers,” Luigi explained. “It’s just that the consequences of not having 100% of your buffer aren’t as dire as they are for failing to be well capitalized.”\n\nHe added that the direct capital relief from the proposed changes would only be enjoyed by the handful of banks that are bound by the eSLR.\n\n“For the banks where the risk-based capital requirements are the binding capital constraints, there will be no relief at all,” he continued.\n\nLuigi concluded that much will depend on the final version of the new SLR rule. He said banks would still like to see at least some Treasury exposures excluded from the calculation to meaningfully increase their intermediation, noting that some of the alternatives considered in the proposal left the door open to that outcome.\n\n“The regulators have proposed these interesting alternatives that are meant to say, ‘OK, we’ve played with the ratio and made sure that it’s a buffer, but we haven’t excluded anything from the denominator – and we know that’s what a lot of the banks want, some exclusion from the denominator,’” he said. “So we’ll see what the comments look like.”\n\n“Stability is the SLR proposal’s goal — but it’s no guarantee,” American Banker (July 1, 2025) (subscription required)",

In the comment letter, we requested that the SEC not approve the adoption and effectiveness of those standards any earlier than that date “in order to give issuers adequate time to develop and adopt a compensation recovery policy, along with the necessary controls and procedures to administer the policy.” We noted that the significant burdens associated with adopting and implementing compliant compensation recovery policies substantially outweigh the limited practical benefits that would be obtained by providing listed companies with any time less than the maximum allowable schedule.\n\nWe obtained the support of over 35 firms to join us in the comment letter.\n\nRead the letter\n\nRead our client updates on the clawback rule and proposed listing standards:\n\nFinal clawback rule adopted by SEC (October 31, 2022)\n\nNYSE and Nasdaq release clawback rule proposal (February 27, 2023)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partners and Restructuring co-heads Marshall Huebner and Damian Schaible discussed notable decisions from 2022 and the outlook for restructuring in 2023 with Turnarounds & Workouts. Marshall pointed to the unexpected Purdue district court decision regarding third party releases as particularly noteworthy. “Third party releases have been an important feature of plans of reorganization for decades,” he explained. “Opining that third party releases are per se unlawful has already led to notable changes in jurisprudence and practice. And the awaited Second Circuit decision will, one way or another, lead to further changes.”\n\nRegarding major trends, Damian noted that “one of the most significant trends from 2022 that will continue and increase in importance is the use by companies of liability management techniques to avoid full-scale traditional restructurings.”\n\n“More Liability Management Deals Seen,” Turnarounds & Workouts (January 2023 issue) (subscription required)",

    "text": "On March 19, 2024, Davis Polk pro bono client Edgardo Quirós-Morales was released from prison into the care of his wife and family after the Federal District Court in Puerto Rico granted his motion for compassionate release and reduced his sentence to 360 months. In 1998, Mr. Quirós-Morales was sentenced to life in prison at the age of 23 for one count of conspiracy to distribute drugs. At the time of his release, he had already served more than 26 years in prison.\n\nAlthough Mr. Quirós-Morales had no prior criminal history, he was sentenced to life in prison because of a then-mandatory sentencing guideline cross-reference. Mr. Quirós-Morales’s sentencing judge applied this cross-reference without stating any basis for doing so. In a motion initially filed in 2021, the Davis Polk team argued that the absence of any factual basis for the cross-reference, the disparity between Mr. Quirós-Morales’s sentence and those of similarly situated co-defendants (who did not receive life sentences), and Mr. Quirós-Morales’s tremendous personal achievements and rehabilitation during his decades of incarceration constituted extraordinary and compelling circumstances warranting compassionate release.\n\nFollowing the Court’s initial denial of Mr. Quirós-Morales’s motion, the Davis Polk team appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, where Civil Litigation associate Marie Killmond argued. The First Circuit vacated the decision and remanded to the district court, where the Davis Polk team conducted supplemental briefing before a new judge. In addition, at the Court’s request, the Probation Office submitted a statement which confirmed that, although it had recommended the cross-reference in 1998, it could identify no basis for this recommendation and under the circumstances it concluded that compassionate release could be appropriate in this matter. On March 15, 2024, the Court issued a 29-page opinion granting Mr. Quirós-Morales’s motion for compassionate release. The opinion adopted many of Mr. Quirós-Morales’s arguments, including that the application of the cross-reference had been improper and the “government’s current insistence” otherwise was “ludicrous.” The Court also noted that its “reasoning is mainly based on the well supported arguments raised by Defendant through his pro hac vice attorneys, in his exhaustive and comprehensive filings before and after remand in this case.”\n\nThe Davis Polk team includes associates Marie Killmond, Kennedi Williams-Libert and Anna Simonovsky. Chief Pro Bono Counsel Amelia Starr, senior counsel Sharon Katz and Counsel, Head of Racial Justice Pro Bono Diane Lucas provided supervision. Associate Henry Goldberg assisted with coordinating Mr. Quirós-Morales’s release following the March 15 opinion.\n\nLearn more about Davis Polk’s Pro Bono program.",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Dan Stipano was quoted in Law360 on the OCC’s revised staff manual and policy changes, which could give the agency more leeway to seek bigger fines against larger banks and potentially increase the future use of restrictions on banks’ business activities as a complementary sanction in enforcement actions. The new changes include expansions to the staff manual’s bank penalty matrix and increases many of the associated penalty amounts. “These increased penalty ranges appear to apply across the board,” Dan noted. “This underscores the likelihood that OCC will assess larger penalties against institutions in future cases.”\n\nDan added that the increase in penalties may be somewhat offset by other changes to the OCC’s bank penalty matrix scoring system. The revised manual also states that the OCC will consider pairing bank fines with business restrictions when appropriate. “By explicitly referencing it in the policy, the OCC appears to be signaling its intention to use business restrictions and other forms of affirmative relief more aggressively than it has in the past,” Dan explained.\n\n“New OCC Policy On Fines Tweaks Enforcement Carrots, Sticks,” Law360 (November 29, 2022) (subscription required)",

Regulators sometimes face difficulty obtaining the data that would yield the most effective results, as this comprises in-company information such as internal payments. “What data is the FCPA unit going to look at? It sounds like they are trying to expand the data sources, and increase the resources to mine that data,” Dan said.\n\nTatiana also highlighted that the DOJ is signaling to prosecutors how seriously to take, and how to weigh, a variety of factors concerning a company’s cooperation in an investigation. She noted that the DOJ is “telling its prosecutors the kinds of questions they should be asking themselves when deciding how much credit to give.” She explained that these questions include, “How much evidence was brought that I couldn’t have gotten otherwise? How timely was it, such that the prosecutor was able to consider investigative steps that would have been impossible if the information had been received later?”\n\n“Coming Year’s FCPA Enforcement Developments Build on Eventful 2023,” Anti-Corruption Report (December 20, 2023)",

    "text": "On May 9, 2023, Davis Polk secured a precedent-setting victory on behalf of our pro bono client Taylor Partlow, a survivor of life-threatening domestic violence. The Appellate Division, Fourth Department resentenced our client under the Domestic Violence Survivors Justice Act (DVSJA) to less than time served, removing over three years from her sentence and making her immediately eligible for release. Davis Polk associate Nikolaus Williams argued the appeal before the Fourth Department on April 3, 2023, with the entire team, Ms. Partlow’s parents and advocates from Willow Domestic Violence Center in Rochester, NY in the courtroom.\n\nThe New York legislature enacted the DVSJA in May 2019 to allow judges discretion to consider the impact of domestic violence when sentencing a defendant who was the victim of substantial abuse that was a significant contributing factor to her crime. A few days after the law went into effect, our client was convicted of first-degree manslaughter for stabbing her abusive boyfriend a single time during a domestic violence incident in which he had violently attacked her and was lunging at her again – with a criminal court order of protection in effect, prohibiting him from being in her presence. Although multiple witnesses testified at trial about numerous domestic violence incidents they had seen Ms. Partlow’s boyfriend perpetrate against her – including acts of strangulation, a predictor of domestic violence femicide – the trial court declined to sentence her under the DVSJA. The trial court held that the abuse she had suffered was not substantial and that it was not a significant contributing factor to her crime. The Fourth Department opinion unanimously held that the trial court erred in finding that the statutory elements of the DVSJA had not been met. In addition, rather than remanding the case to the trial court for resentencing, the Fourth Department took the notable step of resentencing Ms. Partlow itself.\n\nThe decision is the first DVSJA opinion in the Fourth Department and therefore sets an important precedent, which should help countless domestic violence survivors petitioning for relief in the future.\n\nThe Davis Polk team includes senior counsel Robert B. Fiske, Jr. and Denis J. McInerney, counsel and Head of Pro Bono Litigation Dara Sheinfeld, associates Nikolaus Williams, Corey M. Meyer, Josh Pitkoff, Emma Schwartz, and Sarah M. Bartlett, legal assistant Mya Gelber, former associate Christine LiCalzi and former law clerk Hugh Verrier. Professional Responsibility Counsel Jerome G. Snider provided invaluable assistance in preparation for oral argument.\n\nSteven Haber, Litigation and Pro Bono Counsel in Bloomberg L.P.’s Legal and Compliance Department; Garrard R. Beeney, Partner at Sullivan & Cromwell LLP; Kate Mogulescu, Professor of Clinical Law at Brooklyn Law School, David Crow, Associate Appellate Counsel at Legal Aid Society; Alexandra Mitter, Senior Appellate Counsel at Center for Appellate Litigation; and Ross Kramer and Nicole Fidler, Director, Incarcerated Gender Violence Survivor Initiative and Director of Pro Bono (respectively) at Sanctuary for Families all provided invaluable assistance throughout the briefing process. Duane Morris LLP submitted a critical amicus brief on behalf of New York State legislators, which was referenced in the decision. On behalf of our client, Davis Polk is enormously grateful to all of these incredible attorneys who contributed to this life-changing victory.\n\nLearn more about Davis Polk’s Pro Bono program.",

Those that report to the CCO should have an obligation to report red flags, “and CCOs should be responsive to the issues being raised to them,” he said. For many companies, “those measures are already going to be quite adequate.”\n\n“​Experts: Delaware court McDonald’s ruling lowers bar on officer liability,” Compliance Week (March 10, 2023) (subscription required)",

Although picking up, it is still a fairly slow fundraising market, which we expect will continue to improve going into next year,” Alisa explained.\n\nWhen asked about the gender balance in private markets, Sijia noted, “Like many industries, the issue in asset management is not at the entry level. The harder question is always how we can better retain and support women through their careers.” She added that “for the next generation of women professionals, creating and maintaining a system of support, mentorship and opportunity will be key – and I have seen firsthand how investments in these types of women-focused initiatives can have a deep impact on the entire organization.”\n\n“Davis Polk: The changing face of private funds,” Private Equity International (October 1, 2024) (subscription required)",

He said that five years ago, he spent 80% of his time working on chapter 11 bankruptcies and the remainder on out-of-court workouts, and now that ratio is flipped.\n\nThe profile featured Damian’s work advising lenders that banded together to make a deal that allowed all creditors — instead of just some — to participate in a new loan and extension on existing debt. The piece noted that this willingness to align may show investors’ belief that they are better off making friends instead of enemies.\n\nHowever, it’s not always possible and “that’s challenging,” Damian said. “Many of these institutions are repeat players on the investor side and the adviser side. At any given time, we’re working on three or four deals together, and an institution wants in, and you may not be able to facilitate that.”\n\n“The Star Dealmakers Remaking the Rules of Corporate Debt,” Bloomberg (December 23, 2024) (subscription required)",

The arrivals of partners Nick Palumbo, David Penna, Elena Millerman and Ryan McNaughton were also highlighted.\n\nJason concluded, “It’s really a story for us constantly evolving to meet client and market demand.”\n\n“Inside Davis Polk’s quiet finance evolution,” The Lawyer (June 26, 2025)",

Leor also pointed out that CDFs have a different timeline from the typical five- or six-year investment period of PE funds. “Conversely, CDFs have a three- or four-year investment period, during which the proceeds are recycled frequently before eventually being distributed during the harvest period,” he said.\n\n“Contingent Dislocation Funds and Market Disruptions: Appeal, Application and Adoption Before Adverse Events (Part One of Three),” Private Equity Law Report (March 15, 2022) (subscription required)",

Generally, when we’re working on a private credit deal, we are more likely to get something done out of court simply because fewer parties need to agree.”\n\n“There are many more similarities between private credit workouts and broadly syndicated loan workouts than differences,” Damian added.\n\n“How to Win at Restructuring in the Gilded Age of Private Credit,” American Lawyer (August 19, 2024) (subscription required)",

These facilities function as revolving credit lines to cover preliminary expenses, enabling developers to progress toward construction readiness.\n\n“There’s a pretty high barrier to entry to the sector,” David said. “There’s a big moat around it because it is so capital intensive.”\n\n“FINANCING: Data center developers see competition for construction finance, ABS market as off-ramp,” NPM (January 3, 2025) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk and our Pro Bono practice are committed to helping effect systemic change in the realm of racial and social injustice and inequality.\n\nLitigating issues that implicate systemic racism is a key part of Davis Polk’s deep commitment to advancing racial justice, as is representing small businesses and nonprofits that serve diverse communities and creating frameworks through which others can advocate for justice locally.\n\nProtecting the right to record police interactions\n\nDavis Polk and Legal Aid are co-counseling a litigation to vindicate our client’s First Amendment right to record interactions with the police. Specifically, our client recorded the arrest of her former partner on her iPhone. Several days later, the police retaliated by arresting our client, claiming she had interfered in her former partner’s arrest. While all charges were later dropped, our client suffered significant harm due to the false arrest, including both compensatory and non-compensatory damages.\n\nMatthew Stratis Vasilakos, an associate in our White Collar Defense & Investigations practice involved in this matter said: “Building this case from the ground up with a supportive and dedicated team has been a true pleasure. I’ve had the opportunity to fight for our client’s First Amendment rights while learning the nuances of complaint drafting and offensive discovery.”\n\nCreating tools to help communities across the country stop AAPI hate\n\nTo target the broader issue of racism against AAPI individuals in the United States, we partnered with the not-for-profit anti-racism organization Stop AAPI Hate to create a tool kit of resources for use by government leadership and school districts across the country. These materials included a template “Resolution Condemning All Hate Against AAPI Individuals and Communities” to aid in a coordinated effort to have state, county and municipal governments speak out in support of their AAPI community members. School districts wishing to implement Asian-American Studies and Ethnic Studies programs will also utilize the resources we contributed.\n\nJennifer Kim, an associate in our Litigation practice involved in this matter said: “My legal career began at the height of the COVID pandemic when instances of violence and discrimination against the AAPI community were on the rise. This crisis sparked my strong desire to help AAPI clients. Through Davis Polk’s partnership with Stop AAPI Hate, I have worked on two projects so far—one focused directly on addressing anti-AAPI hate and the other centered on promoting ethnic studies. As an AAPI lawyer, the opportunity to do pro bono work for an organization that advances equity and justice by dismantling systemic racism has been such a meaningful and empowering experience.”",

    "text": "Davis Polk today announced that Suzanne Munck af Rosenschold has joined the firm as counsel in the Antitrust and Competition Group in Washington DC. Ms. Munck is a leading authority on both antitrust and intellectual property law with high-level experience at the Federal Trade Commission.\n\n“Suzanne is an outstanding and highly respected antitrust lawyer. Her experience at the FTC is extremely valuable to our clients tackling complex antitrust issues,” said Neil Barr, Davis Polk’s Managing Partner. “We are delighted to welcome her to the firm.”\n\nMs. Munck comes to Davis Polk from the FTC, where she has served for the past 12 years, starting her career in the Bureau of Competition in 2007 and going on to hold two senior positions at the intersection of antitrust and intellectual property law. As Chief Counsel for Intellectual Property and Deputy Director of the Office of Policy Planning, she developed investigation strategies addressing intellectual property issues in public and non-public conduct and merger matters. She also formed attorney and economist teams to promote competition and innovation through research, advocacy, and intra- and interagency collaboration. She led the FTC’s recent revision of the Antitrust Guidelines for the Licensing of Intellectual Property and is the lead author of the FTC report, Patent Assertion Entity Activity: An FTC Study. Ms. Munck also co-managed a study of whether current antitrust and consumer protection doctrine is fit for the modern economy, titled The FTC Hearings on Competition and Consumer Protection in the 21st Century.\n\n“Suzanne is one of the premier competition lawyers in the country,” said Arthur Burke, head of Davis Polk’s Antitrust and Competition Group. “She is an excellent fit for the firm, and her extensive government experience combining antitrust and intellectual property law will further diversify our practice.”\n\nDavis Polk’s antitrust practice combines broad experience in complex corporate transactions with a sophisticated litigation practice. Companies from around the world, as well as their executives and directors, retain our lawyers for their most significant antitrust matters. Our lawyers can bring to bear substantial government experience on all manner of enforcement actions. We frequently act as coordinating counsel for large defense groups, taking the lead in developing and advancing arguments, not only on behalf of our own clients but also on behalf of large groups of firms. In M&A matters, we have successfully obtained antitrust agency approval in numerous significant recent mergers and joint venture transactions.\n\nSuzanne Munck said, “I am deeply grateful for the opportunities I have had to serve in government but am excited for this next step. I feel privileged to move into private practice with Davis Polk’s top-notch Antitrust and Competition Group, a firm and practice I have long-respected.”\n\nPrior to joining the FTC, Ms. Munck was a litigator at Howrey LLP (2004-2007) and Sheppard Mullin (2001-2004). She received an A.B. in Mathematics from Bryn Mawr College in 1996. She received her J.D., cum laude, from the University of Minnesota Law School in 2001, where she was a Managing Editor of the Minnesota Law Review.",

She argued it is a result of anti-money laundering and fraud regulations, which have resulted in “weird incentives where supervisory staff push banks to be as risk-averse as possible.” Margaret continued, noting that the U.S. must enforce a money-laundering system that prohibits wrongful activity but avoids creating an overly cautious culture that results in the wrongful termination of innocent people’s accounts.\n\nDiscussing potential consolidation of the bank regulators, Margaret said, “There will be a root-and-branch reform of the CFPB, rather than the deletion of the organization.” She noted there is a serious need to reconsider how the federal government regulates the banking system, saying, “Why do we have five sets of supervisory staff at the federal level? Can we be more efficient?”\n\n“Jamie Dimon’s Call for Banking Regulatory Reform Resonates With Wall Street,” Observer (March 4, 2025)",

The plaintiffs sought to recover for their losses during the broad, market-wide decline in the value of bitcoin in 2022. They alleged that Iris had concealed risks in its IPO documents and other public disclosures, including about loans that Iris had secured to fund data mining equipment powered by renewable energy. The plaintiffs also asserted that Iris overstated its goodwill in its financials.\n\nDavis Polk moved to dismiss the complaint in its entirety, arguing that none of the statements at issue were false or misleading.\n\n“When you boil down allegations that involve matters in the crypto space and cut through the complexity, the basics of the U.S. securities laws still apply,” Ted explained. “Which is to say that the plaintiffs can’t bring claims for violations of the U.S. securities laws unless they can identify an actual false or misleading statement.”\n\nTed noted that “In this case, the clients at Iris were smart and critical in all of the best ways, and we worked probably more closely than I have ever worked with any other in-house lawyers on any similar motion.”\n\nThe Davis Polk team that represented Iris Energy also included partner Mari Grace, counsel David B. Toscano and associates Charlotte M. Savino, Paulina Perlin, Elaina Marx, Alyssa Metcalf and Paige Whitaker.\n\n“Bitcoin Mining Company That Enlisted Davis Polk Beats Investor Class Action,” Law.com (October 2, 2024) (subscription required)",

    "text": "On June 22, 2023, following an eight-day trial that concluded in March, Judge Oetken of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a favorable decision for our client in a case brought under the Hague Convention. Our client, the mother of two children, fled Spain with her children in 2021 to escape their father’s domestic abuse and out of concern about his connections to organized crime and drug trafficking. The father petitioned under the Hague Convention for the children’s return to Spain. With the court’s decision, the father’s petition was denied.\n\nDavis Polk was initially referred to this case by Sanctuary for Families due to our significant experience litigating Hague matters on behalf of survivors of domestic violence. The trial included direct and cross examinations of both parties, six additional fact witnesses and three expert witnesses. The members of our team, ranging from first-year to senior-level associates, each prepared and conducted witness examinations under a supervision model that Judge Oetken endorsed. Davis Polk submitted a post-trial brief well over 100 pages, from which the Court borrowed heavily in its decision.\n\nJudge Oetken’s opinion not only changes the lives of a deserving family, but serves as an important precedent for future survivors seeking refuge. The Court found two defenses to repatriation to exist – the well-settled and mature child objection defenses – and also ruled that it would cause irreparable harm to separate our client’s two children, one of the first rulings of its kind in the Second Circuit. Importantly, the Court also credited the client’s allegations of domestic violence and the testimony provided by our expert, who conducted a trauma analysis. This finding is critical, both for future custody proceedings, and for the client, who was finally heard and believed.\n\nSince arriving in New York, our client has worked tirelessly to support her children. We will continue to represent her in future custody proceedings as needed to secure the trial victory. In a footnote to the decision, Judge Oetken commended “the pro bono counsel and professionals for the vigor and skill with which they litigated this difficult case, and for their donation of substantial time and resources” and noted that the “pro bono work on this case has been in the finest tradition of this District.”\n\nThe Davis Polk team included Chief Pro Bono Counsel Amelia Starr, counsel Ester del Valle Izquierdo and Head of Pro Bono Litigation Dara Sheinfeld, associates Brendan Blase, Mollie Hamel, Meredith Manning, Ryann Moelis, Maria Morris, James Park, Paul Shortell and Zoë Smith, legal assistant Conor Chmiel and former associate Emma Schwartz. Jacqueline Berkenstadt also participated.",

Margaret noted that “while Europe has created MICA [Markets in Crypto-Assets] and has put in place a regulatory perimeter, we have been engaged in relatively useless battles about whether digital assets should be considered securities or commodities.” She added that “all we really need to be saying is, this is a new asset class and it’s not possible to prohibit it, so let’s focus on creating an appropriate regulatory framework.”\n\nJoe explained that congressional intervention is likely. “Congress may take on the broader question of digital asset regulation and clarify jurisdictional lines between the SEC, the CFTC, and the banking regulators. Adopting this kind of legislation, however, will be difficult to navigate politically.”\n\n“SEC vs. CFTC: how FTX changed the crypto game,” IFLR (February 16, 2023) (subscription required)",

    "text": "A Davis Polk team led by partner and Civil Litigation practice co-head Paul Spagnoletti received a shout out in AmLaw Litigation Daily’s “Litigator of the Week” column for securing the Second Circuit’s unanimous affirmance of the dismissal of a federal RICO lawsuit filed against Apollo co-founder Josh Harris by fellow co-founder and former Apollo CEO Leon Black. The case stems from Black alleging a fraudulent scheme to force him to resign from Apollo by leveraging allegations of sexual abuse by his former romantic partner.\n\nOn appeal, Black did not dispute the merits of the district court’s 62-page decision granting defendants’ motions to dismiss. Rather, he claimed that the district court erred by denying him leave to file a second amended complaint during the pendency of the case and later by dismissing his first amended complaint with prejudice because the RICO claims were “glaringly deficient in fundamental respects.” The Davis Polk team argued that the district court acted well within its discretion when it (i) refused to allow Black to file a second amended complaint in the middle of briefing on defendants’ pending motions to dismiss, against the district court’s prior instructions, and then (ii) determined the first amended complaint was futile without addressing in detail the allegations in the previously rejected proposed second amended complaint.\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit unanimously upheld the district court’s rulings in a summary order that endorsed the arguments made by Davis Polk in favor of affirmance.\n\n“Litigator of the Week Runners-Up and Shout Outs,” AmLaw Litigation Daily (March 10, 2023) (subscription required)",

    "text": "On November 1, following an five-day trial, which concluded in August 2022, Judge Richard Sise of the New York Court of Claims issued a decision in favor of a Davis Polk pro bono client, finding that the State of New York is liable to him for his unjust conviction and imprisonment pursuant to the New York Court of Claims Act Section 8-b. Our client served over 26 years in prison for a crime he did not commit and was released in 2019 after a Davis Polk team assisted in achieving his exoneration. Now, the Court of Claims has found that our client is “actually innocent” by clear and convincing evidence, a higher standard than is required for a criminal conviction. The Court credited our client’s testimony, as well as those of all three fact witnesses – a group of individuals who the team tracked down despite them being respectively incarcerated, living far away, dramatically traumatized by witnessing the crime and unwilling to be deposed. Specifically, the Court noted that “the credible evidence points entirely toward claimant’s innocence.”\n\nThe Court’s decision is not only a personal victory for our client – who has always maintained his innocence, and, as the Court found, did not contribute in any way to his own conviction – it will also serve as an important precedent for others who have been wrongfully convicted and imprisoned.\n\nThe Davis Polk team, which will continue to represent our client as the case proceeds to a trial on damages, includes partner Greg Andres, Chief Pro Bono Counsel Amelia Starr, counsel Craig Cagney and Head of Pro Bono Litigation Dara Sheinfeld, associates Christina Costello, Alexa Jacobson and Zulkar Zhan. Neufeld Scheck & Brustin served as co-counsel.\n\nLearn more about Davis Polk’s Pro Bono program.",

On February 9, 2023, the New York Court of Appeals reversed a judgement by the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division and ordered a new trial in the case of People v. Oscar Sanders. In what the team believes is an issue of first impression nationwide, the Court of Appeals held that the trial court violated Mr. Sanders’s due process rights by restraining him without formal explanation when the jury announced its verdict.\n\nAmelia noted that the successful reversal rings louder than just a win for Sanders. “It’s important for our client for sure — who absolutely deserves a new trial,” said Amelia. “But I think it’s just as important from a systemic perspective, that really sends the message very clearly to the appellate and trial courts that they cannot do this.”\n\n“NY Top Court: ‘Long Forbidden Routine’ of Visible Shackling Applies To Verdict Reading and Jury Polling,” The Crime Report (March 1, 2023)",

    "text": "A Davis Polk team led by partner Elliot Moskowitz received runner-up honors in AmLaw Litigation Daily’s “Litigator of the Week” column for securing dismissal of all claims brought against lenders that participated in a financing transaction involving Mitel.\n\nOn December 31, 2024, Davis Polk won an appellate victory in the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department, for a group of lenders that participated in an October 2022 financing transaction undertaken by Mitel, a major Canadian telecommunications provider. Following the 2022 transaction, the participating lenders were sued, in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of New York, by other lenders that did not participate in the 2022 financing.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the plaintiffs challenged liens securing more than $850 million in debt owed to the participating lenders, and sought money damages on the basis that the restructuring transaction allegedly violated the terms of preexisting credit agreements, the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and New York’s Uniform Voidable Transaction Act (NYUVTA), among other claims.\n\nDavis Polk filed on behalf of our clients comprehensive motions to dismiss, and on December 5, 2023, Justice Jennifer G. Schecter dismissed the plaintiffs’ claims for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, tortious interference with contract and violation of the NYUVTA.\n\nThe parties appealed the trial court’s ruling to the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, First Department. The appeals were argued on October 8, 2024, and on December 31, 2024, the panel of five First Department justices unanimously ruled in favor of the participating lenders on all counts.\n\nThe panel agreed with the position of the participating lenders and Mitel that the 2022 transaction complied with the terms of the preexisting credit agreements and likewise did not implicate the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. Accordingly, the panel unanimously affirmed the dismissal of the good faith and fair dealing claim and modified the trial court’s ruling to dismiss all surviving declaratory judgment and breach of contract claims asserted against the participating lenders.\n\nThe Davis Polk team also included counsel Marc Tobak and associate Adam Greene.\n\n“Litigator of the Week Runners-Up and Shout-Outs,” AmLaw Litigation Daily (January 9, 2025) (subscription required)",

Margaret, head of Davis Polk’s Financial Institutions practice, and Lee were honored for their work advising financial institution clients throughout the recent banking crisis, including JPMorgan on its acquisition of the assets and liabilities of First Republic.\n\nNew York Law Journal also named Davis Polk a “Litigation Department of the Year” finalist, an honor bestowed upon firms with a New York presence that have demonstrated excellence in litigation over the past year. Among the firm’s major recent wins, Davis Polk secured a landmark Second Circuit decision affirming Purdue Pharma’s bankruptcy plan and obtained a rare dismissal of criminal charges brought by the DOJ Antitrust Division against our client for allegedly participating in a wide-ranging conspiracy to fix prices and rig bids for broiler chicken products.\n\nThis year’s honorees will be featured in New York Law Journal’s upcoming “Professional Excellence” report and will be celebrated on October 5 at the New York Legal Awards.",

He noted that the type of potential transaction – for instance, a public deal, a private deal or an auction – and the motivations of the various players are among the factors that make every situation different.\n\n“My day can involve back-to-back conference calls; day-long, in-person negotiations; or multiple hours reviewing long draft agreements. M&A work involves a constant juggling of important, time-sensitive tasks for clients. It also involves familiarity with other aspects of law and coordination with colleagues in other practice areas at Davis Polk. For example, I might consult with colleagues in the Antitrust, Executive Compensation, and Tax practices and serve as the point person synthesizing our advice to the client in the context of the transaction,” Daniel explained.\n\n“Practice Area Insights: Mergers & Acquisitions,” Vault (October 25, 2023) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Gabe Rosenberg was quoted in American Banker discussing financial institutions’ use of AI and its potential regulation. He said that until regulators fully understand the back-end mechanics of AI models and uses they will be unlikely to give their blessing.\n\n“If you think about regulation and examinations, generally they are a study of what financial institutions do and how to incentivize them to do the right things, but if you don’t really know why they’re doing what they’re doing, that becomes really difficult,” he said. “I think there are concerns that the AI would be making decisions based on the wrong things, like that they’d be looking at correlation between events rather than causation.”\n\nHe noted the potential that a wide swath of banks will make similar decisions as a result of relying on similar AI models – a phenomenon often referred to as herd behavior. While not a new risk, he said, regulators will be eyeing this closely, noting remarks recently made by SEC Commissioner Gary Gensler calling for regulators to be attentive to the potential for herd behavior.\n\n“Herd behavior is a concern anywhere traders all look at the same signals,” he said. “If everyone does the same thing at the same time, that can lead to both bubbles, as we see in the meme stocks and crashes, when people do the same thing. It reminds me of the run on repo during the 2008 financial crisis, where everyone had set up the same risk web and [did] the same thing at the same time, which caused a lot of problems.”\n\nGabe also noted that there is still significant uncertainty as to the extent to which generative models can predict unprecedented edge-case scenarios, something even human examiners struggled to anticipate in the 2008 financial crisis and bank failures this year. AI is trained on historical data, so it may have a blindspot towards less-predictable outcomes.\n\n“By definition, tail risks either are super uncommon, or there’s something we just think about and don’t know about in advance,” he said. “Just like the financial regulators, the industry sees things in retrospect that should have been obvious, people are worried the same will happen to AI and won’t be able to react to them in real time.”\n\n“Given regulatory uncertainty, banks will take tentative steps to embrace AI,” American Banker (November 7, 2023) (subscription required)",

In the Q&A, Sheila discusses her road to partnership, why she joined Davis Polk, the key to successful business development, how to grow professionally in a hybrid work system and advice for associates, among other topics. “First and foremost, I think the most important piece of advice is to be excellent in your work. Next, it is best to treat every project or assignment as an opportunity to both demonstrate your skills and to do great work for, and with, your supervising associate or partner,” she said. “I would also advise, particularly early on, to be a sponge: Gain as much experience in your chosen practice area as possible, make a commitment to always improve, and challenge yourself continuously to be the best version of yourself as a person and professional.”\n\n“How I Made It : ‘I Demonstrated a Commitment to Developing the Next Generation of Lawyers at the Firm,’ Says Sheila Adams of Davis Polk,” Law.com (May 18, 2022)",

The awards are presented annually to a select group of individuals and institutions that have made extraordinary contributions through pro bono legal services that help nonprofits to address critical human needs and improve the quality of life for thousands of low-income New Yorkers.\n\nDavis Polk has partnered with Lawyers Alliance for more than 30 years, and the organization recognized the firm’s longstanding commitment to pro bono work and serving its nonprofit clients “with the same determination and legal excellence that define the firm’s broader culture.” Lawyers Alliance noted that Davis Polk received one of the first Cornerstone Awards, in 1997, and “is the rare recipient of a second Institutional Cornerstone because of the continued breadth of its corporate law and transactional pro bono work, especially as nonprofits have needed timely legal help during the pandemic.”\n\nThe awards were presented on December 2, 2021.\n\nRead more about Davis Polk’s work with Lawyers Alliance of New York\n\nLearn more about Davis Polk’s Pro Bono program.",

But she approached each of these mediations differently, which showed that she was thinking about what would really work best in each instance.”\n\n“She’s not going to be a mediator who indulges people’s fantasies, which sometimes happens in mediation,” he continued. My sense is she will do it politely, but she will tell people that she thinks they’re off base, which I think is a very good characteristic to have in a mediator.”\n\n“Tailored Approach,” Daily Journal (September 8, 2023) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk, working with the Legal Aid Society, secured the release of pro bono client Carlos Weeks, who served 26 years in prison after being wrongfully convicted of second-degree murder and first-degree assault. Mr. Weeks had steadfastly maintained his innocence in the case, which arose out of a July 1993 shooting in the Tompkins Housing Projects in Brooklyn that left one victim dead and a young child injured.\n\nAt a hearing on October 3, 2019, in the New York State Supreme Court for Kings County, Justice Dineen Riviezzo vacated Mr. Weeks’s conviction, dismissed the original indictment and ordered his immediate release.\n\nAt his trial in 1995, the only evidence connecting Mr. Weeks to the shooting was the purported eyewitness testimony of two sisters. At trial, they claimed to have looked out of a twelfth-floor apartment window and identified Mr. Weeks as the shooter. They claimed they ran down the stairs, but their respective testimonies as to what they saw when they reached street level was in conflict.\n\nDavis Polk and Legal Aid began their investigation of the case in early 2015 after reviewing the trial testimony and meeting with Mr. Weeks. Davis Polk and Legal Aid obtained police files, attorney’s files, and tracked down and interviewed potential witnesses. Through photographic evidence, Davis Polk and Legal Aid established that the sisters could not have seen what they claimed to have seen through the twelfth-floor window. In addition, the investigation revealed the sisters’ motivation for their false testimony, which stemmed from their desire to assist the son of one of the sisters in securing possible favorable treatment in connection with an unrelated arrest.\n\nDavis Polk and Legal Aid also identified new alibi evidence placing Mr. Weeks in another location at the time of the shooting. And they located a key prosecution eyewitness, who had been expected to testify at trial, but was at the last minute not called. That witness has now confirmed that he would have testified that Mr. Weeks was not present during the shooting.\n\nDavis Polk and Legal Aid presented the new evidence to the Kings County District Attorney Conviction Review Unit (“CRU”) in October 2017, and cooperated fully with its investigation, including making Mr. Weeks available for an interview.  A June 2019 submission further laid out the basis for the vacatur of the conviction.\n\nWhen the CRU confronted one of the sisters, she recanted her testimony, stating she had been under “too much pressure.” The other sister declined to speak with any of the investigators, except to claim to the CRU that she had no recollection of the underlying events.\n\nThe Davis Polk team included associates Craig T. Cagney and Jennifer M. Maloney, legal assistants Theresa Bruney and Mohamed Ali Ismail, and Special Counsel for Pro Bono Sharon Katz. Associate Patrick Moroney assisted in the early stages of the investigation.",

She added that this would be similar to the revisions to NEPA regulations issued during his first administration.\n\n“These revisions included changes that narrowed the scope of projects subject to NEPA review and gave discretion to agencies to avoid consideration of climate change in assessing environmental impacts and they might again be featured in NEPA regulations issued during the second Trump term,” Loyti explained.\n\n“Top Climate Change Policies To Watch in 2025,” Law360 (January 1, 2025) (subscription required)",

This was the second time Davis Polk obtained dismissal of all claims in the case, brought on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of TME stock. The plaintiffs had alleged that TME, a music entertainment platform in China, made material omissions in its IPO registration statement and 2018 annual report because TME did not disclose that TME was the subject of scrutiny by Chinese antitrust regulators looking into potentially anticompetitive practices.\n\nJudge LaShann DeArcy Hall granted defendants’ motion to dismiss an earlier iteration of the plaintiffs’ complaint in 2021, and the March 31 order makes clear that the court found their next attempt to state a claim no more compelling. In rejecting all of the plaintiffs’ claims, Judge DeArcy Hall adopted several of the arguments that Davis Polk had advanced in briefing, including that the plaintiffs’ allegations about a meeting with regulators were contradicted by documents incorporated in their own complaint, and that the defendants’ disclosures about that meeting were in fact completely consistent with the documents the plaintiffs themselves relied on.\n\nIn addition, on March 30, 2023, a Davis Polk team led by Brian Weinstein and counsel Jonathan Chang secured dismissal of the first U.S. securities class action arising from the PRC government’s ban on for-profit tutoring. Judge Paul Oetken of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granted with prejudice Davis Polk’s motion to dismiss the putative securities class action filed against Davis Polk’s client Zhangmen Education Inc., which was a leading after-school tutoring service provider for students in China at the time of its IPO in June 2021. Less than two months after the IPO, the PRC government unveiled a sweeping overhaul of the after-school tutoring industry, which included barring for-profit tutoring businesses, such as Zhangmen’s.\n\nIn granting the motion to dismiss, Judge Oetken adopted Davis Polk’s arguments and held that Zhangmen’s registration statement included extensive disclosures of regulatory risks, which “rendered any misleading statement it may have made immaterial”; that there was “no duty to disclose all details of regulatory fines”; and that the pre-IPO fine issued by the PRC government was immaterial as a matter of law.\n\n“An Early Batch of Litigator of the Week Shout Outs—With a Twist,” AmLaw Litigation Daily (April 11, 2023) (subscription required)",

John noted that many investment firms have been looking for transactions where debt is not required because of the lack of available debt at attractive interest rates, which means that minority stakes and co-investments have become more popular. “Other sponsors are sitting on the sidelines for now until prices settle down further and the debt markets reach their levels, so that everything be properly priced,” he said.\n\nJohn also explained that the healthcare services industry may become an active area for investors in the coming months, given that it is perceived as recession resistant.\n\n“How private-equity firms, rich with investors’ cash, plan to capitalize on a souring economy,” Business Insider (November 16, 2022) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner Jesse Solomon was quoted in IFLR discussing the revisions to the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Act’s pre-merger notification rules.\n\nThe article notes that while the final rule is onerous, it is not as tough as it could have been. “This was a meaningful retrenchment on what was in the draft rule,” Jesse said. “Despite the extra burden, cost and time it will take to comply, the draft rule was far more extreme in scope and burden.”\n\nHowever, it will take some time to see the effect of the final rule. “Some elements of the form are ambiguous and may pose questions about how to implement, such as the new requirement to produce documents from supervisory deal team leads,” he said. “Judgment calls will need to be made. We don’t know yet, and won’t for some time, how this form will be implemented.”\n\nHe added that while the new form could produce more streamlined and efficient pre-merger reviews, it could also lead to further FTC action. “It is also possible that more documents and data supplied upfront could generate more agency activity upfront and lead to longer, more complex reviews on more deals which could then prompt requests for increased agency budgets,” Jesse said.\n\nNoting that the final rule received a unanimous vote, Jesse noted, “Clearly some compromises were made to get to a bipartisan 5-0 vote, which may have been to reduce the risk of litigation challenge.”\n\nJesse noted that the new form changes the U.S. approach of so-called backloading requests for information in this area, compared to other parts of the world. “Many other jurisdictions, such as the European Union and Brazil, require more information upfront,” he said. “The US has historically backloaded information. The new HSR form is tantamount to a transatlantic journey east, though not the full way to Europe.”\n\n“New requirements for US pre-merger information will increase burden on clients,” IFLR (November 22, 2024) (subscription required)",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner and National Security practice head Paul Marquardt was quoted in International Financial Law Review discussing the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) and its evolving approach to national security.\n\nDiscussing the transformation of CFIUS over time, Paul said, “One of the interesting aspects of CFIUS is that the statute deliberately doesn’t define national security. It’s literally whatever the president says it is, and that has evolved significantly over time.”\n\nHe noted that while most companies strive to maintain a working relationship with CFIUS, particularly if they are repeat players, the day may come when a party challenges the committee’s authority. “CFIUS is pushing the outer limits of what it can do under existing mitigation agreements, and eventually it’s going to bump up against those limits,” he said.\n\n“The expansion of what CFIUS considers to be a national security issue has been significant over the last 20 years, moving beyond direct defense-related industries to include technology, personal data, infrastructure, and supply chains,” he added.\n\nThe article notes that the U.S. government has heightened its scrutiny of foreign investments that could expose Americans’ data to non-U.S. entities. “The big themes recently are data and supply chains, with a growing emphasis on personal data,” Marquardt says.\n\nNoting that extended reviews and mitigation have become more common, Paul explained, “With over half of the notices extending beyond the initial review period, certain transactions will naturally require movement into the investigation period.”\n\nThere are also a number of challenges companies can face. Paul noted, “CFIUS often delivers draft mitigation agreements late, and they often contain commercially unworkable terms. It takes time to address their concerns while making the agreement feasible for the business.”\n\n“Timing and burden are the two pieces that our clients are most concerned about, and CFIUS is, unfortunately, not primarily concerned with either of those things,” he continued.\n\nThe article noted that at the core of CFIUS’s reviews is a delicate balancing act between national security concerns and the operational needs of businesses. “The government is not a commercial entity and often does not understand the operations of the business in detail, and so understanding both the commercial realities and the government’s underlying concerns is crucial,” concluded Paul.\n\n“Clifford Chance and Davis Polk partners explore CFIUS’ evolving role as a proactive regulator and reveal emerging client strategies,” IFLR (September 4, 2024) (subscriptions required)",

    "text": "Amidst great political division and active voter suppression efforts, the 2022 midterm elections brought confusion, misinformation, and fear to many voters across the country; 165 members of the Davis Polk community, including clients, lawyers, business services professionals, summer associates and alumni, were there to help.\n\nFor many years, Davis Polk has supported the national, nonpartisan Election Protection Hotline (866-OUR-VOTE) organized by the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law (Lawyers’ Committee), by both volunteering at its regional call centers that operate year-round and hosting an Election Day call center.\n\nLast year, with all 435 seats in the House and 35 seats in the Senate up for re-election, we again partnered with the Lawyers’ Committee and hosted a two-day Election Protection Call Center. Between November 7 and November 8 alone, Davis Polk’s call center fielded approximately 1,300 calls, texts and chat messages from voters across the country – accounting for more than 10% of the Election Protection Hotline’s total volume for the period. This was also the culmination of a months-long volunteer effort, during which members of our community staffed regional call centers leading up to the election.\n\n“It was a huge undertaking to coordinate shift coverage and ensure that every volunteer was trained to respond to a range of questions in a shifting legislative landscape,” explained Pro Bono Attorney for Corporate & Transactional Matters Jillian Berman, who served as Davis Polk’s call center lead.\n\nAlthough our team was initially slated to field inquiries only from the New York area, a few weeks before Election Day the Lawyers’ Committee asked for our help in taking on more states. Given that voting laws vary by state, Davis Polk lawyers quickly worked to create reference materials to cover our expanded territory encompassing five additional states.\n\nVolunteers worked in four-hour shifts beginning as early as 5:00 a.m. ET and ending as late as 9:30 p.m. ET. They responded to inquiries from voters in New York, Tennessee, Delaware, Rhode Island, Connecticut and Washington DC.\n\nThe questions from voters spanned topics such as registration status, poll locations, and ID requirements, and volunteers worked with on-the-ground command centers to escalate reports of intimidating or suppressive obstacles to voting.\n\n“Having grown up in a state with relatively straightforward voting requirements, I did not fully appreciate how difficult it was to vote in other parts of the country before I started volunteering with Election Protection. Answering people’s calls and hearing the challenges and the hurdles placed in front of them is horrifying, but there is some comfort in knowing we are able to help,” Jillian said.\n\nAs part of Davis Polk’s commitment to free and fair elections, the firm also partners with other nonpartisan organizations on voting-related legal research projects including on the materiality clause of the Civil Rights Act and its application to voter registration and ballots, election fraud allegations related to the 2020 election, and preventing political violence often directed at elected leaders and election officials.\n\nLearn more about Davis Polk’s Pro Bono program.",

    "text": "Davis Polk partner and Financial Institutions practice head Margaret Tahyar was featured on Bloomberg Television’s “The Close.”\n\nIn the episode, Margaret discusses the state of the banking crisis and next steps. “I think we’re entering another phase. It’s panic, emergency measures, then we move to root cause – which some might think of as ‘where are we going to find and assign the blame?’ – and then we move to reform,” she explained. “Linking the root cause to the reform is an important step, otherwise we have a mismatch.”\n\nMargaret also noted that there is a key difference between regulation and supervision. “I think of it as an iceberg. Ten percent is the public stuff: regulations, the law, public guidance – and most of the commentary is on that ten percent – but in the system of how we regulate and supervise banks, ninety percent is the iceberg below the water – it’s what the supervisors do.”\n\nWhen asked what she thinks the next steps should be in terms of supervision, Margaret said, “I think what should happen is a real change in how we think about supervision. Supervisors are heroes. They are under-resourced, understaffed, doing multiple jobs without the tools and the technology. But they’re also doing it behind the scenes without transparency, and that doesn’t necessarily lead to good outcomes even when you have good people doing it. So, I think we need to find a balance of more transparency and give more resources and more tools to the supervisors.”\n\n“Bloomberg Markets: The Close,” Bloomberg Television (starting at the 1:57:40 mark) (March 30, 2023)",

What we’ve seen as more capital and more talent has flooded the market over the last 10 years is a natural evolution,” Leor explained. “Things have evolved to be more sophisticated and specialized. I don’t see that slowing down anytime soon.”\n\nLeor noted that the secondaries market is currently very robust. “We are seeing every type of deal across industries. We’re seeing a lot of variability in pricing and in products, and we’re seeing more fundraising in secondaries. It’s just active and healthy in a much broader way… One of the measures at Davis Polk that we look at, and we’re obviously reflective of the market is, how many matters do we have open, how many of our sponsor-side clients are actively looking and how many matters do our buy-side clients have active at the moment? We’re running right now close to double what I would view as our kind of normative numbers on both ends.”\n\n“How specialised can the secondaries market get?” Second Thoughts (March 10, 2025)",

Founded in 1950, the College is composed of the best of the trial bar from the United States and Canada. Fellowship in the College is extended by invitation only and only after careful investigation, to those experienced trial lawyers of diverse backgrounds, who have mastered the art of advocacy and whose professional careers have been marked by the highest standards of ethical conduct, professionalism, civility and collegiality. Lawyers must have a minimum of 15 years trial experience before they can be considered for Fellowship.\n\nMembership in the College cannot exceed one percent of the total lawyer population of any state or province. There are currently approximately 5,800 members in the United States and Canada, including active Fellows, Emeritus Fellows, Judicial Fellows (those who ascended to the bench after their induction) and Honorary Fellows. The College maintains and seeks to improve the standards of trial practice, professionalism, ethics, and the administration of justice through education and public statements on independence of the judiciary, trial by jury, respect for the rule of law, access to justice, and fair and just representation of all parties to legal proceedings. The College is thus able to speak with a balanced voice on important issues affecting the legal profession and the administration of justice.\n\nRamani was inducted as a Fellow at the College’s Spring Meeting on March 7, 2020.",

We recognize the often-underreported struggles that this group of Americans faces and want to support the important conversations and education needed to fight these injustices and attacks.\n\nOn March 23, we will host Dr. Russell Jeung, professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University, who will discuss the path to ending hate against the AAPI community. In March 2020, Dr. Jeung co-founded Stop AAPI Hate, an organization that tracks incidents of discrimination and uses this data to develop policy interventions and long-term solutions to racism. Dr. Jeung is the author of several books and articles on race and religion, including Family Sacrifices: The Worldviews and Ethics of Chinese Americans, and Mountain Movers: Student Activism and the Emergence of Asian American Studies.\n\nI hope you will join us for this important conversation and in supporting our colleagues and community members every day.\n\nNeil",

We think of ourselves as partners with our clients, providing them with practical and thoughtful advice to help them take their businesses where they want them to go.”\n\nShe also noted that the Inflation Reduction Act had a large impact on her practice and on the advice she provides to her clients. “We now have a whole new tax regime—the corporate alternative minimum tax—and a stock buyback excise tax, not to mention all the new energy credits,” she said. “These changes will have sweeping consequences for many of our clients across industries and circumstances, and will need to be taken into consideration in all of our corporate transactions.”\n\n“Spotlight on New York Corporate Tax Attorney Kara Mungovan,” Bloomberg Tax (April 14, 2023)",

This is notable for three key reasons: (1) it confirms the FTC’s focus on enforcing the interlocking directorate prohibition; (2) it involves an enforcement against a non-corporate interlock; and (3) it shows a willingness to use a merger review to unwind preexisting joint ventures.\n\n“What the FTC has done in going beyond the express authority conferred by Congress is controversial,” Jesse explained.\n\nCorporate Counsel also referenced Davis Polk’s client update on the matter, which noted that the FTC action involving Quantum and EQT is a consent decree and not binding on the courts. However, in advance of potential merger reviews, companies should proactively evaluate possible non-corporate interlocks and existing bi-lateral relationships, “including those arising from a potential transaction.”\n\n“Antitrust Enforcers Throw Wrench Into M&A by Dusting Off Long-Ignored Governance Rule” Corporate Counsel (September 11, 2023) (subscription required)",

A central focus during incident response when it comes to notice is the state and consumer protection requirements. Those are precise notice requirements [with a few familiar components.] The SEC materiality requirement can be more complicated.”\n\nRobert continued, “It is important to be able to show after the fact what process the company used and why it was reasonable, and also that you had the right people involved, the right amount of resources [invested] and the right structure.”\n\n“SEC Cyber Rules: How to Prepare for the New 8-K Incident Mandate,” Cybersecurity Law Report (August 10, 2022)",

Oliver has a wide-ranging M&A practice encompassing U.S. and cross-border mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures and restructuring transactions. Oliver also represents private equity firms and their portfolio companies in all aspects of their businesses. In 2024, the American Lawyer named Oliver a “Dealmaker of the Year” for his work advising ExxonMobil on its $59.5 billion acquisition of Pioneer Natural Resources. Law360 named Oliver an “M&A MVP of the Year” in 2018 and again in 2024.\n\nHoward Shelanski joins Art Burke as co-head of the firm’s Antitrust & Competition practice. Howard is one of the nation’s leading authorities on antitrust and regulation, with high-level experience at the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission and in the Executive Branch. He is also a Professor of Law at Georgetown University. Howard advises clients on the antitrust aspects of their most important mergers, acquisitions and strategic partnerships across a range of industries. He also represents clients in conduct investigations by federal, state and non-U.S. antitrust authorities, and provides counsel on a variety of general competition and regulatory matters. From 2013 to 2017, Howard served as Administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. Before that, he was Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Economics. Howard also served as the FCC’s Chief Economist and as a Senior Economist for the President’s Council of Economic Advisers.\n\nMeyer Dworkin has assumed the role of head of Structured Finance. Meyer advises lenders and borrowers on a wide range of finance transactions, including private credit and syndicated acquisition and other leveraged and investment-grade financings, asset-based financings, debtor-in-possession and other distressed financings, and structured credit financings. Since 2019, Meyer has advised on approximately $60 billion of structured credit financings across more than 260 transactions for leading private equity and private credit investors and financial institutions. His structured credit practice includes work on NAV facilities, capital call facilities, and single-asset and portfolio back-leverage transactions secured by liquid and illiquid debt, equity and other asset classes. In addition, he represents hedge funds, private equity funds and corporations in negotiating prime brokerage, derivatives and repurchase agreements, as well as other trading and financing documentation and complex structured financial products.",

    "text": "Davis Polk Restructuring co-head Damian Schaible and Restructuring partner and head of Liability Management & Special Opportunities Brian Resnick were quoted in Petition on the biggest bankruptcy themes and takeaways of 2023.\n\nDiscussing the biggest restructuring theme in 2023, Damian said, “‘The deal away’ — We’ve gotten used to liability management being all the rage for overlevered sponsor portfolio companies. But we used to speak in terms of ‘lenders vs. lenders’ in non-pro rata deals. Enter private credit funds, and we now have ‘lenders vs. the deal away’ in more and more situations. Lenders grouping together to try to offer the sponsor a better deal in terms of cheap liquidity, maturity extensions and — increasingly — discount capture against the specter of a dropdown, double-dip private credit deal…”\n\nBrian said, “Liability management transactions is the obvious call. For cases that do file for chapter 11, we’re seeing an increasing number of mid-market companies (often failed SPACs) filing with 363 sale credit bids instead of going concern reorganizations. With rates going ‘higher for longer,’ and more companies that relied on cheap funding getting stressed, that trend seems likely to continue and even increase.”\n\nBrian noted Purdue as the most impactful restructuring matter of the year. “If third party releases are not available in chapter 11, it will significantly narrow options for distressed companies facing significant tort claims, and would deprive these tort claimants of a vehicle to maximize recoveries and contributions from third parties,” he said.\n\nDamian’s choice for most impactful restructuring was The Boy Scouts of America emerging from bankruptcy. He said, “It’s an incredibly important organization doing significant work for and with children across the economic spectrum. Teaching leadership, self-reliance, organization and character while providing life-changing opportunities to youth across the nation, in particular to under-privileged youth. The horrors of abuse should not be understated or swept under the rug. And the bankruptcy system worked well to provide compensation to the survivors, incentivize real change and radical improvement to facilitate ongoing service to the youth of our nation.”\n\nOn the most clever restructuring matter of the year, Brian noted, “The liability management ‘pari plus’ technology deployed in Sabre, which expanded on the At Home double DIP.”\n\nDamian agreed, saying, “I am not sure if it was too clever for its own good, but the At Home ‘double-DIP’ financing deserves a shout-out, as it has become a model we at least talk about a lot in the market now.  It is not clear whether the particular structure will hold up if ever challenged and it used technology that has been around and used for a long time, but it certainly resulted in a lot of attention and focus on similar structures in other deals.”\n\n“BK Pros Weigh In.

In the Q&A, Paul discusses his practice, his career path and what motivates him. He also shares his thoughts on how to achieve successful outcomes for clients by providing wise advice, sound judgment and a usable risk assessment.\n\nWhen asked what strengths and characteristics he and the firm strive to demonstrate to clients, Paul noted, “One of our greatest strengths is how closely we are embedded with our transactional and white-collar practices… You do not have a sanctions team and a litigation team; you have a Davis Polk team, and we have all worked together closely before. We do not have high walls separating practice areas, fights over who gets credit for what, or territoriality among ourselves, and I think it shows in our work.”\n\n“International Trade & Sanctions 2023 - Distinguished Advisers,” Financier Worldwide (December 2023)",
